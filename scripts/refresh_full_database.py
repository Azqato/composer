refresh_full_database.py: Fetch fresh backtest data from the Composer API
for entries in data/database.json (the full ~6,800-symphony raw database,
distinct from the 35 curated strategies in data/strategies.json).

Target schema (locked in PRD.md Section 14, V1.9.1): every DIRECT_FIELD is
overwritten in full on every successful call (no partial/backfill merging),
and fields with no meaningful value for an entry are stored as explicit
null rather than omitted, so every entry in database.json always has the
same set of keys.

`flag`/`error` (PRD.md Section 12 / V1.14 Part B, consolidated v1.11.9,
split v1.11.11) are the single source of truth for a row's error/warning
state - written directly here on every call, replacing the older separate
script_errors/data_warnings fields. `flag` is "excluded" | "caution" |
"retry" | null (the category); `error` is the original message/object
(a script error string, or Composer's data_warnings object) or null.

Entries whose refresh_date is less than STALE_AFTER_DAYS old are skipped.
Saves a checkpoint every CHECKPOINT_EVERY rows so a crash mid-run (e.g. an
unprintable character in a strategy name, a network blip) never loses
progress already made.

WARNING: this script loads database.json into memory once at startup and
overwrites the whole file with that in-memory copy on every checkpoint.
While this run is active in the background, do not run any other script
that also writes database.json (
sync_storage_to_database.py); their changes will be silently overwritten
on this script's next checkpoint. Stop this script first if you need to
run one of those.

Usage:
    python scripts/refresh_full_database.py [LIMIT] [--force]

    LIMIT: optional int, max number of rows to process this run (default:
    all rows due for refresh). Use a small LIMIT to test in batches before
    running against the full backlog.

    --force: ignore the staleness check and re-refresh every entry with a
    symphony_id, including ones updated today. Needed the first time this
    script runs after a schema change (e.g. V1.9.1's field expansion),
    since rows refreshed under the old schema look "fresh" by refresh_date
    but are missing the new fields.
