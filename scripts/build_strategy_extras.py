build_strategy_extras.py: join the 31 featured strategies to the full database
and to the K-1 database, and write the result as a small file the strategy
pages can load directly.

    data/strategies.json  +  data/database.json  +  data/k1.json
      +  data/ticker_inception.json
        -> data/strategy_extras.json  +  data/strategy_extras.js

Why a build step and not a browser join. `data/database.json` is 6,669 entries
and roughly 5 MB. Shipping it to a strategy page so that page could read one
row out of it would undo the page-weight work done in v1.16. The join key is
`symphony_id`, it is stable, and it changes only when the featured set changes,
so it belongs in a build artifact rather than in every visitor's browser.

Why it fails loudly. A missing `symphony_id` would otherwise render a strategy
page with an empty metrics block: still HTTP 200, still laid out correctly,
simply missing the sections. That is the same failure shape that took the
Signal Miner down in v1.22.2 and it is the reason check_html_js.py exists. So a
join miss here is a non-zero exit, not a warning.

Usage:
    python scripts/build_strategy_extras.py

Run it after any refresh that touches data/database.json or data/k1.json, and
after adding or removing a featured strategy. scripts/check_strategy_extras.py
rebuilds this in memory and fails the deploy if the committed file disagrees,
so a forgotten run is caught rather than shipped.

This script is deliberately NOT wired into .github/workflows/update-metrics.yml.
A join miss must fail the person who caused it, at their desk, rather than
breaking the nightly metrics job and its sitemap commit for everyone.

    actual length, because measurement says those are different things:

      floor, so the bound is real. But not one starts AT it either. 18 of 31

      their window; the other 13 begin well after, up to 5.6 years late for

      years, limited by UVXY" for every strategy. That sentence is true for
      roughly half of them and asserts a false cause for the rest.

    `dated` vs `total` is carried so the page can refuse to name a limiter it
