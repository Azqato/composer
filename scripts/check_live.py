"""Lint what Cloudflare actually serves, rather than what git says was pushed.

Cloudflare Pages deploys independently of the GitHub Actions gate, and the
build command cannot be changed from here, so "pushed" and "live" are
genuinely different states. This has been checked by hand more than once; it
is twenty lines and belongs in the deploy runbook.

    python scripts/check_live.py                  # check every page
    python scripts/check_live.py signal-miner     # check one

For each page it:
  1. fetches the live clean URL,
  2. compares it byte-for-byte against the committed file,
  3. checks the markers that must be present and the ones that must be absent.

Exits non-zero on any mismatch, so it can gate a release.
