"""Deploy gate: data/database.json is keyed by symphony_id, and the summary matches it.

`symphony_id` is the primary key of the community database. Nothing enforced
that until v1.25.2, and by then one duplicate had been sitting in the file for
an unknown length of time: two rows for chkrQ6BnXCw31n7OIEaK, identical except
that one URL ended /details and the other /factsheet. It got in because
sync_storage_to_database.py deduplicated on the URL string rather than the id,
so a second URL for the same symphony read as a new symphony. That specific hole
is closed, but the file is also edited by hand (the AddSymphony.csv route, and
ad-hoc cluster corrections), and a hand edit cannot be prevented by fixing a
script. So this gate checks the invariant on the artifact itself, whatever
produced it.

Four checks, each on a failure that is silent without one:

  1. Every entry has a non-empty symphony_id. A null key makes every
     downstream join wrong and nothing would say so.
  2. symphony_ids are unique. A duplicate shows the same symphony twice in
     every list view and counts it twice in every total.
  3. The id embedded in symphony_url matches the symphony_id field. These are
     written by different code paths at different times and can disagree;
     a mismatch means one of them is lying about which symphony the row is.
  4. database_summary.json has the same row count, in the same order, as
     database.json. The site reads the summary, not the full file, so a stale
     summary makes real symphonies invisible with no error anywhere. This
     drifted once already: four symphonies were unreachable on the live site
     until v1.25.1 (see docs/PRD.md Section 24, discrepancy 5).

Read-only. Exits non-zero on any failure, so it can gate a release.
