add_zoop.py — One-time script that added the "Zoop's Strategies" glossary entry
(slug: zoop) and applied the 'zoop' tag to all 11 zoops-* strategies in

Already applied as of v1.5.3 (2026-06-15). Safe to re-run — duplicate-slug check

The 11 strategies in this collection span a spectrum from capital-preservation-first (2026 Frontrunner) to high-conviction aggressive (Sometimes TQQQ, Leveraged TQQQ Symphony).",
        "Each strategy shares a common lineage: the 2026 Frontrunner is the base layer, using RSI-triggered dip-buy signals on a universe of leveraged ETFs with BIL as the default. The other strategies layer additional macro signals, sector momentum filters, and bear-mode intelligence on top of this foundation — each one a different answer to the question of how aggressively to pursue returns within a risk-managed framework.",
        "Across the 11 zoops-* strategies, the backtested annualized return ranges from 92% (2026 Frontrunner) to 182% (Sometimes TQQQ) over a 14.2-year backtest period, with Sharpe ratios ranging from 1.47 to 2.66 and max drawdowns from −22% to −37%. This spread reflects the spectrum of risk tolerance the collection is designed to address."

      "title": "Design Philosophy",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Zoop's strategies share several design principles that distinguish them as a coherent system rather than a collection of unrelated symphonies. First: the primary defense mechanism is always a combination of macro trend confirmation (SPY or QQQ above key moving averages) and RSI-based dip-buy signals — both protective and opportunistic at the same time. The strategy exits leveraged positions when the macro trend breaks, but actively re-enters at panic RSI levels rather than waiting passively in cash.",
        "Second: SH (1x inverse S&P 500) is the default bear-mode hold across most zoops-* strategies, not BIL. This is an explicit directional view: when the bull-regime conditions break, the market is more likely continuing to fall than recovering — so holding SH generates returns from that decline rather than sitting at the risk-free rate. This distinguishes the zoops-* strategies from purely trend-following approaches that use cash as the defensive position.",
        "Third: each strategy in the collection is designed to be held as a single portfolio allocation, not combined with each other. The strategies overlap significantly in signal logic — combining two zoops-* strategies would create correlated double-exposure rather than meaningful diversification. The collection exists to give investors of different risk tolerances a single appropriate choice, not to be held simultaneously."

    {
      "title": "Community and Transparency",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Zoop publishes and discusses his strategies publicly, sharing the signal logic, backtest methodology, and performance tracking openly with his community on Twitch and YouTube. ComposerAtlas was built to document this library in one organized, searchable place — providing the in-depth explanations, signal breakdowns, and risk metric comparisons that aren't possible within Composer.trade's interface alone.",
        "The strategies are identified in Composer.trade with the 'zoops-' prefix, making them discoverable and attributable. The '2026' suffix in each strategy name reflects the year these versions were refined and published — Zoop iterates on his strategy suite over time, and the year suffix helps track which version a given backtest represents.",
