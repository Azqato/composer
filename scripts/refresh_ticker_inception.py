refresh_ticker_inception.py: fetch a real first-trade date for each ticker and
write:
  - data/ticker_inception.json
  - data/ticker_inception.js   (window.TICKER_INCEPTION_DATA, file:// twin)

Why this file exists rather than reusing data/prices.json. V1.20 item 9 needs
one true inception date per ticker so a strategy page can say WHY its backtest
window is the length it is. prices.json cannot answer that, for two independent
reasons, and the second one is fatal:

  1. It covers the Signal Miner universe, which overlaps the featured
     strategies' 105 held tickers on only 44 of them.
  2. It starts at 2010-01-04, so every ticker that listed earlier reports
     2010-01-04 as its first close. Measured: 48 of its 72 tickers do exactly
     that. It cannot tell "listed in 2010" from "listed in 1993", so a readout
     built on it would report SPY as starting in 2010 when it launched in 1993.

That is not a coverage gap that more tickers would fix. It is the wrong
instrument. Hence a separate artifact holding one date per ticker, roughly 25
bytes each, fetched once and refreshed rarely because inception dates do not
change.

Source: the Yahoo chart API's `meta.firstTradeDate`, an epoch second the API
returns alongside any price request. Asking for `range=1d` keeps each response
tiny: we want one field, not a price history, so there is no reason to download
one. Spot-checked against known launches: SPY 1993-01-29, QQQ 1999-03-10,
TQQQ 2010-02-11, IBIT 2024-01-11.

Usage:
    python scripts/refresh_ticker_inception.py            # featured set (~105)
    python scripts/refresh_ticker_inception.py --all      # every held ticker
    python scripts/refresh_ticker_inception.py --missing  # only unfetched ones

Runs are ADDITIVE: existing entries are kept and merged, so `--all` after
`--featured` extends the file rather than replacing it, and an interrupted run
loses only the tickers it had not reached. No API key required.
