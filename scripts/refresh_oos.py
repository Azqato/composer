"""Fetch true out-of-sample statistics for the Leaderboard's candidate set.

Writes data/oos.json and its .js twin, keyed by symphony_id. See docs/PRD.md
V1.18 for the design and the decisions behind it.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT AND A SEPARATE WORKFLOW.
    refresh_full_database.py already runs 4.5 to 5 hours against GitHub's
    6-hour job ceiling. A second API call per row does not fit beside it, so
    this runs on its own day, over its own scoped set of rows.

WHAT "OUT OF SAMPLE" MEANS HERE.
    `oos_date` is the symphony's last logic edit (`last_semantic_update_at`).
    Every day after it is a day the author did not tune against, so a backtest
    starting there is a genuine out-of-sample record. This is the only sense of
    out-of-sample the data supports, and it has a property worth stating: it
    rewards leaving a symphony alone, and resets the moment its logic is
    edited.

THE TRAP THIS SCRIPT EXISTS TO AVOID.
    The API honours `start_date` and `end_date`. It SILENTLY IGNORES `start`
    and `end`, returning the full backtest with a 200 and no warning of any
    kind. A version of this script with the wrong key name would look like it
    worked perfectly and would publish in-sample numbers labelled
    out-of-sample, which would make the Leaderboard look validated precisely
    where it is not. Every response is therefore checked against the window it
    was asked for, and a row that fails is discarded rather than stored. See
    check_window().

Usage:
    python scripts/refresh_oos.py            # the whole candidate set
    python scripts/refresh_oos.py 300        # first 300 due rows, for a smoke run
    python scripts/refresh_oos.py --force    # refetch even rows already current
