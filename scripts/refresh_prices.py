refresh_prices.py: Fetch full daily adjusted-close history for the Signal Miner
ticker universe and write:
  - data/prices.json
  - data/prices.js   (window.PRICES_DATA, for file:// compatibility)

The Signal Miner page (signal-miner.html) reads this committed data and runs the
entire signal-generation + backtest in the browser. No live fetching happens
client-side (Yahoo's chart API is CORS-blocked from browsers and rate-limits
datacenter traffic), so this script plays the same role refresh_rsi.py plays
for the RSI page: a server-side (or local) fetch that commits static data.

Usage:
    python scripts/refresh_prices.py

No API key required. Run from the project root. Intended to run on a weekly
schedule via a GitHub Action; safe to run manually any time.

# Moved from 2018-01-01 to 2010-01-01 in v1.20.1. 2010 covers the entire
# leveraged-ETF era (TQQQ, UPRO and SPXL all launched 2008-2010), so the funds
# most people actually mine signals on now have their full history. Going back
# further mostly adds nulls: very few of this universe existed before 2010, and
# Signal Miner's common sample window starts at the LATEST first-valid date
# among the selected tickers, so one modern ticker in a selection collapses the
# window back anyway. The cost is paid by every visitor on page load.
#
# KNOWN AND ACCEPTED (owner decision, 2026-08-20): a few tickers do not mean the
# same thing this far back. SVXY was reformed in Feb 2018 from -1x to -0.5x, and
# Yahoo's VXX is the Series B ETN that launched in 2018 after the original was
# retired. Their pre-2018 rows therefore describe a different product. This was
# raised and explicitly waived, so there are deliberately NO per-ticker
# earliest-valid-date overrides here. See docs/PRD.md. If that decision is ever
# revisited, this is the place to add them.
