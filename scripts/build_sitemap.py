build_sitemap.py: Regenerate sitemap.xml from what the site actually serves.

Why this exists: robots.txt has advertised https://composeratlas.com/sitemap.xml
since the file was written, and until 2026-08-24 that URL 404'd on both hosts.
This script generates the real thing rather than leaving a hand-written file to
go stale the next time a page or a strategy is added.

What goes in:

1. Every top-level .html page that is genuinely indexable. The list is derived,
   not hardcoded, so a new page appears in the sitemap without anyone
   remembering this script exists. Three exclusion rules, each for a reason:
     - 404.html          error document, not content
     - _*.html           local mockups and harness pages, gitignored and listed
                         in .assetsignore
     - any page carrying <meta name="robots" content="noindex">
                         currently signal-lab.html, superseded by
                         signal-miner.html
2. One URL per curated strategy, as strategies.html?slug=<slug>. These are real
   distinct pages despite sharing one HTML file: strategies.html sets a per-slug
   <title> and meta description at render time (see strategies.html, the
   renderStrategy path), so each slug is its own document to a crawler that runs
   JS. The database is deliberately NOT enumerated this way; 6,669 query-string
   URLs of thin, near-identical rows is exactly the sort of thing that gets a
   sitemap ignored.

lastmod comes from the data where the data knows: each strategy carries its own
`last_updated`. For pages it comes from the file's last commit date via git,
and is simply omitted if git is unavailable or the file is untracked. An absent
lastmod is fine; a wrong one is worse than none.

changefreq and priority are deliberately not emitted. Google has stated it
ignores both, and every value anyone picks for them is a guess.

Canonical host is composeratlas.com (Cloudflare Pages). The GitHub Pages mirror
at azqato.github.io/composer/ is not given its own sitemap on purpose: it serves
the same content and should not compete for it.

Usage:
    python scripts/build_sitemap.py

Run it after adding a page, or after any run of scripts/update_metrics.py or
anything else that changes the curated set in data/strategies.json.
