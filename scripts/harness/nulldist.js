/* Empirical null for the Signal Miner search (V2.2 item C, the N-adjustment).

   MEASUREMENT, NOT A GATE. This exists to answer a question the tool cannot
   currently answer about itself: the Miner searches millions of candidates and
   reports the single best number it found, which is the maximum of a very large
   sample and optimistic by construction. How optimistic?

   THE NULL, AND WHY IT IS BUILT THIS WAY.
   The target's log-return series is rotated circularly inside the run's scored
   window, and the same search is run against the rotated target. Rotation is
   chosen over drawing random signals for three reasons that each matter:

     1. It preserves the TARGET exactly: its return distribution, its volatility
        clustering, and its drawdown structure all survive, because it is the
        same series read from a different starting point. A synthetic target
        would have to model all three and would be wrong about at least one.
     2. It preserves every SIGNAL exactly, including its firing rate and its run
        lengths. A random boolean array with matched time-in-market would not:
        real signals fire in blocks, and block structure is most of what drives
        max drawdown, which is the denominator of Calmar.
     3. It preserves the DEPENDENCE BETWEEN CANDIDATES, because it is the same
        lattice of specs being searched. This is the one that decides the whole
        design. docs/PRD.md Section 14 item C warns that closed-form
        multiple-testing adjustments "assume independence that a dense lattice
        badly violates". Searching the real lattice against a scrambled target
        makes no independence assumption at all: whatever correlation the
        candidates have with each other, they still have it here.

   The only thing rotation destroys is the ALIGNMENT between signal and target,
   which is precisely the relationship being tested. That is what a null is.

   THE ONE ARTIFACT, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. A circular rotation splices the
   end of the window onto its start, creating one artificial day-to-day join per
   rotation. Over a window of several thousand days that is one joined day out
   of thousands, and it is the standard cost of a rotation test. It is not
   swept under the rug: the harness reports the window length so the ratio is
   visible.

   WHY ROTATION IS BOUNDED INSIDE THE WINDOW. `lret` carries NaN before a
   ticker's listing date, and `backtest` maps NaN to a zero return. Rotating the
   whole axis would drag those NaNs into the scored window and quietly convert
   them to flat days, biasing the null DOWNWARD, which is the dangerous
   direction: a suppressed null makes a real row look better than it is. So only
   [s0, N) is rotated, which is exactly the span `backtest` reads.

   WHAT IT REPORTS.
     - The best-of-k curve for the real target and for the null, at several k,
       so the growth of the maximum with search size is measured rather than
       assumed.
     - The real search's best against the distribution of null bests, as a
       percentile. This is the honest headline: if the real best sits at the
       50th percentile of what the same search finds on scrambled data, the
       search found nothing.
     - The same for the median row, to show the effect is about the MAXIMUM and
       not a level shift across the board.
