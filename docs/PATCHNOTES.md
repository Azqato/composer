## [1.38.12] - 2026-09-01

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 11 (final): SOXX Group verified against a complete read of its
  logic tree (2,643 nodes, the largest in the library).** Every verifiable claim matched the tree:
  the UVXY 30-day RSI > 63 volatility gate, the 30-20-10 SMH double-pop RSI cascade, the single-day
  SMH magnitude tiers (-3/-5.5/-7 down, +3.5/+4.5/+5.5 up), the SMH RSI(10) < 30 SOXL dip-buy, the
  four-instrument universe (BIL/BSV/SOXL/SOXS), and the SOXL FTLT fallback (SPY 10-day max-drawdown,
  SVXY 5-day return, TQQQ 60-day RSI). Only metric drift needed fixing (ARR 111% -> 110%, volatility
  66% -> 67%, Sharpe 1.46 -> 1.44, Calmar 1.61 -> 1.60).
- **This completes the full-tree content audit of all 22 non-zoop curated strategies** begun in
  v1.38.1. Every non-zoop strategy's prose has now been checked sentence-by-sentence against a full
  read of its Composer logic tree, per the mandatory full-tree rule.

## [1.38.11] - 2026-09-01

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 10: s90 50/40 maxDD (Half Low Catch) and The Four Horsemen of the
  Apocalypse verified against complete logic-tree reads.**
  - **s90 (Half Low Catch)**: corrected a structural misdescription. The symphony is an equal-weighted
    50/50 blend of a dormant "low catchers" deep-dip waterfall AND a fully-invested "s90 50/40 maxDD"
    bull/bear regime strategy, not a mostly-cash dip-buyer. Removed the false "frontrunner defaults to
    BIL", "sits in BIL most of the time", and "does nothing most of the time" framing (BIL is only a
    ~6.7% bear-branch ballast sleeve), and described the regime half's overbought-hedge ladder and
    leveraged baskets. Verified the low-catch waterfall thresholds against the tree (all matched) and
    aligned large drift from the extended window (ARR 735% -> 470%, Sharpe 3.04 -> 2.58, Calmar 24.81
    -> 11.46, DD 30% -> 41%, backtest 551 -> 605 days).
  - **The Four Horsemen**: mechanics matched the tree exactly (parallel SPY-200d and TQQQ-20d
    components, dual UVXY guards, top-3-of-5 21-day momentum filter, RSI(7) bottom-1 TECL/SOXL
    dip-buy, TLT/PSQ/BSV filter, deep-bear QQQ 252-day protocol, TQQQ<31 -> TECL cascade). Only
    metric drift needed fixing (ARR 167% -> 162%, Sharpe 2.18 -> 2.14, Calmar 3.68 -> 3.58).
- Drift check clean on both, all deploy gates pass. One strategy (SOXX Group) remains in the sweep.

## [1.38.10] - 2026-09-01

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 9: SOXL Growth (Original) and Sometimes TQQQ (Original) verified
  against complete logic-tree reads.**
  - **SOXL Growth**: resolved an internal contradiction. It holds the deepest drawdown in the library
    (88%), not the "second-deepest at 82%" the AI summary claimed; corrected the volatility ranking
    (third-highest, behind Beta Ballers and The Gold Miner, not "second only to The Gold Miner");
    replaced a "top-?" placeholder in the inverse-basket signal with the actual rule (bottom 2 by
    3-day cumulative return of TMV/SQQQ/SPXS); aligned drift (ARR 143% -> 135%, DD 82% -> 88%, Sharpe
    1.47 -> 1.43, Calmar 1.74 -> 1.54).
  - **Sometimes TQQQ**: the five-regime tree (priority RSI dip-buys, bull Choppy/Bull 1/Bull 2, bear
    Bear 1/Bear 2) matched the traced logic; tightened the Bear 1 description (it keys off QQQ's
    20-day MA and TLT-vs-SQQQ RSI, not "QQQ and TQQQ moving averages") and aligned drift (ARR 326.5%
    -> 320.3%, Sharpe 2.76 -> 2.73, Calmar 7.17 -> 7.03, DD 45.6% -> 45.5%).
- Drift check clean on both, all deploy gates pass.

## [1.38.9] - 2026-09-01

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 8: Super Semiconductors and Simon's KMLM Switcher (Original)
  verified against complete logic-tree reads.**
  - **Super Semiconductors**: mechanics matched the tree exactly (SPY EMA8-vs-SMA200 gate, dual SPY
    RSI guards, SMH MACD 12/26 branch with SHY/SMH hedge and SOXL dip-buy, top-3 chip momentum
    filter, and the bear-mode SOXL/SSG/SOXS logic). Aligned drifted figures (ARR 103% -> 99%, Sharpe
    1.71 -> 1.66, Calmar 2.39 -> 2.32).
  - **Simon's KMLM Switcher**: corrected the first dip-buy branch, which reads TQQQ's oversold RSI
    but expresses the trade through TECL, not TQQQ (the other three buy the ETF they measure). Fixed
    the outdated "2x long VIX futures" UVXY descriptor and aligned drift (ARR 654% -> 612%, Sharpe
    3.01 -> 2.90, Calmar 20.42 -> 19.10, backtest 1,049 -> 1,098 days).
- Drift check clean on both, all deploy gates pass.

## [1.38.8] - 2026-09-01

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 7: TQQQ For The Long Term (Original) and Inside Nancy Pelosi's
  Chips - V3 verified against complete logic-tree reads.**
  - **TQQQ For The Long Term**: mechanics matched the tree exactly (SPY 200d gate, dual TQQQ/SPXL
    overbought guards to UVXY, TECL/UPRO dip-buys, SQQQ-vs-TLT RSI filter, SQQQ oversold override).
    Aligned drifted figures (ARR 165% -> 160%, Sharpe 1.86 -> 1.83, Calmar 3.08 -> 2.99).
  - **Inside Nancy Pelosi's Chips - V3**: corrected a mis-read trend gate. The normal-regime routing
    keys off a SOXX 10-day-vs-200-day EMA cross, not "10d EMA vs current price", and the direction
    was inverted in the prose: an uptrend routes to the chip momentum filter (top-1 of SOXX/NVDA/
    AMD/XLE/ENPH) and a downtrend to the defensive filter (top-2 of SPY/DBC/XLE), the opposite of
    the previous "contrarian tilt" description. Also made the two co-equal NVDA/AMD sleeves explicit,
    fixed the drawdown ranking ("deepest" -> second deepest, behind SOXL Growth), and aligned drift
    (ARR 73% -> 75%, Sharpe 1.10 -> 1.11, Calmar 0.85 -> 0.87).
- Drift check clean on both, all deploy gates pass.

## [1.38.7] - 2026-09-01

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 6: The Holy Grail (Original) and 10d BND vs. 10d SPHB (Original)
  verified against complete logic-tree reads.**
  - **The Holy Grail**: removed fabricated mechanics. The tree holds a single asset at full weight in
    every state with no fixed rebalance schedule, so the claimed "80% TQQQ allocation" and "5%
    rebalance corridor" were untrue and have been rewritten to describe the actual single-asset,
    signal-driven holding. UVXY re-described from "2x long VIX futures" to a leveraged long
    VIX-futures ETF. Aligned drifted figures (ARR 154% -> 150%, Sharpe 1.80 -> 1.77, Calmar 3.24 ->
    3.17, volatility 62% -> 63%).
  - **10d BND vs. 10d SPHB**: mechanics matched the tree exactly (BND-vs-SPHB relative RSI regime,
    SOXX overbought guard, UVXY 74/84 tiers, SOXL dip-buy override). Aligned the one drifted figure
    (ARR 100.6% -> 98.5%).
- Drift check clean on both, all deploy gates pass.

## [1.38.6] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 5: Top Cap by MA + RSI and The Gold Miner (Original) verified
  against complete logic-tree reads.**
  - **Top Cap by MA + RSI**: aligned drifted figures (ARR 133% -> 127%, Sharpe 1.64 -> 1.60, Calmar
    2.31 -> 2.20); corrected the "leveraged attack" branch, which is a bottom-1 pick of the worst
    5-day performer (mean reversion), previously called a "momentum filter"; UVXY re-described from
    "2x long VIX" to leveraged long VIX futures.
  - **The Gold Miner (Original)**: mechanics matched the tree exactly (GDXU RSI gates plus the
    QQQ/GDXU/TLT momentum routing). Corrected a false backtest claim: the March 2021 record does
    include the sharp 2022 gold-miner selloff (likely the source of its ~48% drawdown), not "none of
    the 2022 commodity bear".
- Drift check clean on both, all deploy gates pass.

## [1.38.5] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 4: SPY Energy Chips and Wooden ARKK Machine 2.2 verified against
  complete logic-tree reads.** Mechanics matched the trees; fixes were metric drift plus one
  structural overstatement:
  - **SPY Energy Chips**: aligned drifted figures to live values (ARR 74% -> 71%, Sharpe 1.19 ->
    1.17, Calmar 1.13 -> 1.09).
  - **Wooden ARKK Machine 2.2**: aligned drifted figures (ARR 244% -> 229%, Sharpe 2.25 -> 2.18,
    Calmar 5.48 -> 5.14), corrected the backtest length (about 4.3 years / ~1,080 days from mid-2022,
    was "4-year / 1,028-day / 2021 to 2024"), and removed a wrong "90% allocated portfolio" claim
    (the tree holds one asset at full weight).
- Drift check clean on both, all deploy gates pass.

## [1.38.4] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 3: Ob Os Staple my Bonds and Mean Reversion (Python) verified
  against complete logic-tree reads.** Both are small trees whose mechanics were accurate; fixes
  were factual, not structural:
  - **Mean Reversion (Python)**: corrected "82% annualized" to about 79% (live ARR) and "a Calmar of
    exactly 1.00, where the annualized return equals the maximum drawdown" to the actual 0.97 (return
    has not quite repaid the drawdown); tightened a ">" comparator description ("reached or exceeded"
    to "is above").
  - **Ob Os Staple my Bonds V0.0**: corrected "17.4% annualized" to 17.3% (live), and removed a wrong
    ticker ("VBF ... ticker BFUGX"; VBF is the Invesco Bond Fund closed-end fund). Its "lowest max
    drawdown in the library" claim was verified true (-19.6%).
- Drift check clean on both, all deploy gates pass.

## [1.38.3] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 2 (smallest structures first): Triple Accelerator and Dip Buying
  Tech verified against complete logic-tree reads.** Both are small three-state trees; mechanics were
  accurate (window values confirmed via the `lhs-fn-params`/`rhs-fn-params` schema, so RSI(10) and the
  200-day MA are correct). Corrections applied:
  - **Triple Accelerator**: UVXY re-described from "2x long VIX ETF" to "leveraged long VIX-futures
    ETF" (UVXY has been 1.5x since 2018), and extended-stat figures aligned to stored values
    (turnover ~12.6, skewness 1.14, win rate ~56%).
  - **Dip Buying Tech**: fixed XLK's fund name from "iShares U.S. Technology ETF" to "Technology
    Select Sector SPDR Fund".
- Note: the outdated "2x long VIX" description of UVXY recurs in several not-yet-audited strategies
  (holy-grail, four-horsemen, simon's-kmlm-switcher, sometimes-tqqq); each will be corrected as its
  own audit reaches it.
- No metric changes; drift clean on both, all deploy gates pass.

## [1.38.2] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **Full-tree content audit, batch 1 of the curated-library sweep: Safe Sectors or Bonds and TQQQ or
  Not rewritten from a complete logic-tree read.** Continuing the process begun with Beta Ballers
  (v1.38.1), each page is now reconciled against every node of the symphony's `score` tree rather than
  its top-level structure.
  - **TQQQ or Not (Original)**: corrected a material structural error. It is not "default TQQQ with
    overrides"; below a single top overbought gate (TQQQ RSI(10) > 79 to UVXY) the book is a 50/50
    blend of two sleeves that run at once, a "BlackSwan MeanRev BondSignal" sleeve and a "Pop"
    pop-bot ensemble gated by VIXM. The "Mean Rev" branch was also mis-described (it is a small
    TQQQ/cash check, not the QQQ/SMH tiered dip-buy, which lives in the Pop sleeve). `description`,
    `ai_summary`, `how_it_works`, `signals` and `risk_profile` concentration updated.
  - **Safe Sectors or Bonds (Original)**: content matched the (trivially small) tree; corrected the
    factual overclaim "longest backtest in this library" to "one of the longest (about 27 years)",
    since `dip-buying-tech` and `ob-os-staple-bonds` are longer. "Lowest volatility in the library"
    verified true and kept.
- No metric changes; drift check clean on both, all deploy gates pass.

## [1.38.1] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **Beta Ballers (Original) rewritten from a full 874-node logic-tree read**, correcting material
  errors: it is predominantly mean-reversion (46 of 74 filters pick the weakest performer), not the
  "momentum machine" first described; the only top-level switch is BIL-vs-IEF RSI (its other branch
  is tiny) with the SPY 210/360 comparison being a recurring inner gate, not a master switch; the
  large sub-tree is driven by a TLT interest-rate regime; the held universe is 33 instruments with
  TLT/IEF/HIBL/SPY used as signals only.
- **New standing rule (docs/PRD.md Section 11)**: for curated strategies, read the entire logic tree
  before drafting or revising content, and hold every sentence to a factual bar (metrics, mechanics,
  provenance, interpretation). Defines the distinct roles of `description` (lede), `ai_summary`
  (analyst's read) and `how_it_works` (mechanics) so the three no longer repeat each other.

## [1.38.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- **Three new curated "(Original)" strategies, the seeds of the most-remixed concepts in the full
  database.** A name-phrase clustering pass over all 6,669 `data/database.json` names (counting
  distinct symphonies per shared phrase, after stripping author-attribution chains) surfaced the
  largest remix families that were not yet featured. The three most-forked were added following the
  standard "Adding a Strategy from a Composer URL" workflow (live backtest metrics, logic tree,
  `ai_summary`, `how_it_works`, `signals`, `risk_profile`):
  - **Beta Ballers (Original)** (`mlgAKFuUIPZiCT0aV7ho`), the original "Beta Baller + TCCC"
    collaborative build behind roughly 200 forks. A 30-plus-instrument regime-switching ensemble.
    721% ARR, -78% max drawdown, 2.69 Sharpe, from a December 2019 backtest start.
  - **TQQQ or Not (Original)** (`g0J87gnk7SausotpUoCt`), the seed of the "hold TQQQ, but only
    sometimes" family. 109% ARR, -30% max drawdown, 2.05 Sharpe, multi-cycle window from around 2011.
  - **Safe Sectors or Bonds (Original)** (`DtlEo2Y1DWR7hngZkxTB`), the most-copied defensive template,
    a daily lowest-RSI rotation across staples and bond/muni funds. 21% ARR, -41% max drawdown,
    1.25 Sharpe, and at a 1999 start one of the longest backtests in the library (about 27 years).
- Curated set grows from 31 to **34**. `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`,
  `data/strategy_extras.json`/`.js`, `scripts/add_ai_summary.py`, `sitemap.xml` (34 strategy pages)
  and the homepage "Curated" stat all updated. All three IDs were already present in
  `data/database.json`, so the `strategy_extras` join is clean (34 of 34, 0 misses).

### Notes
- **The remaining seven families from the analysis are documented, not built (deferred).** The full
  ranked table, plus honorable mentions and a separate cohort of trend-gap candidates, lives in
  Section 14 (V2.2) of the PRD for when the set is next expanded.
- **Prose follows the v1.37.0 convention:** the new entries state fixed backtest start dates rather
  than year-durations, so nothing drifts as `backtest_days` grows. `check_stat_drift.py` reports no
  drift on the three new pages (the pre-existing drift on older pages is unrelated and unchanged).

## [1.37.1] - 2026-08-30

### Changed
- **Dropped the separator comma from the freshness chips** on strategy detail pages. They now read
  "Headline metrics Aug 24, 2026 7 days ago" rather than "Aug 24, 2026, 7 days ago". The date
  already contains a comma, so a second one two words later gave the chip two different jobs for the
  same punctuation mark and read as a stray mark rather than a separator.

## [1.37.0] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- **89 stale performance figures across 29 of 31 strategies, in `ai_summary` and `how_it_works`.**
  Fixing `risk_profile` in v1.36.0 corrected one field's copy of the numbers and left the others.
  `ai_summary` renders on the same page, a few hundred pixels higher, and recited the same
  statistics.
- **`s90-half-low-catch` was the worst page on the site.** Its summary advertised a Calmar of 24.81
  against a live **11.69**, a 735% annualised return against a live **479%**, and a 30% max drawdown
  against a live **41%**: the strategy overstated in both directions at once, on the same page that
  displayed the correct numbers in a table. `zoops-manhattan-project-2026` had the same problem
  smaller, with a 35% drawdown against a live 39%.
- **Three comparative claims are corrected rather than stripped.** `soxl-growth-rl` called its
  drawdown "the second-deepest in the entire library" when it is now the deepest.
  `nancy-pelosi-chips` claimed both "the weakest risk-adjusted profile in the library" and "the
  deepest max drawdown here"; `dip-buying-tech` has a weaker Sharpe and Calmar and SOXL Growth
  (Original) has a deeper drawdown. `mean-reversion-py` described "a Calmar of exactly 1.00, the
  breakeven line", and it has since fallen below it, reversing the point the sentence was making.

### Added
- **`scripts/check_stat_drift.py`**, which parses every performance figure out of every prose field
  and compares it to the live metric. This is the piece that was missing: the rot went unnoticed
  through every nightly `update_metrics.py` run because nothing was looking. Tolerance is the
  prose's own rounding, so a figure written to one decimal is wrong only if it rounds to something
  else, and a design fact ("RSI below 30", "SOXL can lose 80 to 90 percent") is never mistaken for a
  portfolio statistic.

### Changed
- **Durations dropped from prose, start dates kept.** `backtest_days` grows every night, so "roughly
  14 years" drifts, while "the backtest begins in late 2011" is fixed and is the half that tells a
  reader which crises the record contains. The window card from v1.33.0 owns the length.

### Notes
- **The new checker had a real bug, and the fault-injection tests caught it before it shipped.** Its
  number pattern captured the sentence-ending period, `float("3.68.")` raised, and a
  `try/except ValueError: continue` swallowed the claim: **every figure that ended a sentence was
  invisible to it.** A checker written to find silent failures was failing silently. The except
  clause is gone; a wrong pattern now raises instead of under-reporting. 12 of 12 injected faults
  behave correctly, including the two false-positive traps: "90.0% annualized standard deviation"
  must not be read as a 90% return, and design facts must not be read as statistics at all.
- **Prose is now clean: 0 checkable figures remain, down from 131.**
- **Verified by rendering all 31 pages in headless Edge** (never Chrome): risk profile intact and
  `ai_summary` still rendering its paragraphs on every page. 0 failures of 31.
- **Neither checker is a deploy gate yet.** That decision is still open for the owner and now covers
  both scripts. Prose is clean today, so a gate would cost nothing now and would stop the next
  figure from being typed in.

## [1.36.0] - 2026-08-30

### Changed
- **All 31 strategies now carry categorised risk profiles** (V1.20 item 10 complete). The pilot was
  signed off and the remaining 30 strings were rewritten: 20,657 characters of undifferentiated
  prose became 29,525 across six named categories. A reader with a specific worry can now find it
  by heading on every strategy page rather than on one.
- **The `Attribution: created by ...` sentences were deleted** from `super-semiconductors` and
  `soxx-group` rather than relocated, because `author_note` already carried the identical credit on
  both.

### Fixed
- **Thirteen comparative claims were wrong and have been corrected.** The pilot found that the
  duplicated statistics had gone stale; at full scale the same problem had corrupted the
  comparisons too. Two orderings had flipped outright: `soxl-growth-rl` was described as having the
  second-deepest max drawdown behind `nancy-pelosi-chips` and now has **the deepest**, and it was
  described as having the highest standard deviation in the library, which is now The Gold Miner.
  `nancy-pelosi-chips` was called "the only strategy below 1.0" on Calmar; **four** now are.
  `top-cap-ma-rsi` claimed a Sharpe "above most leveraged ETF strategies" when **21 of 31 are
  higher**.
- **One claim was wrong when written, not drift.** `soxl-growth-rl` called its window "the longest
  in the library". Two unleveraged 27-year strategies are far longer. It now reads "the longest of
  the leveraged strategies", which is what was meant.
- Every trading-day count quoted in prose had drifted. Those figures are dropped; the window card
  added in v1.33.0 owns them.

### Notes
- **Absence claims were grounded in the ticker data, not in the old prose.** Omitting a category
  makes the page assert something, so every omission was checked against the strategy's reachable
  universe in `strategy_extras.json`. That gives **8 absent rows across 6 strategies**: `leverage`
  omitted only on the two genuinely unleveraged strategies, `hedge` only where no inverse or
  volatility instrument is reachable at all, `signal` only where the original recorded none and
  inventing one would have been fabrication.
- **The same data produced claims the original prose could not make.** `soxx-group`'s only
  defensive position is SOXS, 3x inverse semiconductors, so its defensive state is a leveraged bet
  on the sector it is defending against; `gold-miner-original` has the identical problem with GDXD;
  and `simons-kmlm-switcher` holds SVIX alongside UVXY, opposite sides of the same trade.
- **Verified by rendering all 31 pages in headless Edge** (never Chrome), not by spot check. Every
  page: verdict badge present, 5 category rows, correct labels in order, zero blank bodies, and the
  legacy `.risk-box` gone. **0 failures of 31.**
- **`.risk-box` is now unexercised but deliberately kept.** `risk_profile` is hand-edited and the
  string form remains valid, so a future entry written as a string must render rather than vanish.
- **`check_risk_profiles.py` is still not a deploy gate.** The question is still open for the owner,
  and it is now less hypothetical: with all 31 entries as objects, a mistyped category key renders
  as silently missing content on a page that still returns 200 and still looks correct.

## [1.35.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Categorised risk profiles on strategy pages** (V1.20 item 10, **pilot on 1 of 31, held for owner
  sign-off**). `risk_profile` may now be an object with a required `verdict` plus optional
  `leverage`, `backtest_limits`, `signal`, `hedge`, `concentration` and `suitability`. A reader with
  a specific worry can find it by heading instead of reading a 734-character median blob.
- **`scripts/check_risk_profiles.py`**, validating the shape of every strategy's `risk_profile`. A
  mistyped category key does not crash anything: it renders that category as silently missing, which
  is the same failure shape `check_html_js.py` exists to prevent, and no existing gate reads this
  field. **Not wired into `deploy.yml`**; whether it becomes a fifth gate is an open question for the
  owner rather than a side effect of a content edit.

### Changed
- **The roadmap's four categories were not used, because they were never checked against our own
  text.** They came from a screenshot of a comparable tool. Reading all 31 strings shows they are
  each attested but cover about a third of what is written, and miss the two largest themes: the
  aggressiveness verdict opens **31 of 31** strings and the backtest window is discussed in **20 of
  31**, and neither had a bucket. Six data-derived categories shipped instead.
- **Bare statistics are dropped from risk prose; comparisons are kept.** The metrics table owns the
  numbers.

### Fixed
- **The duplicated statistics had already gone stale, which is what settles the question.**
  `four-horsemen`'s prose claimed "Sharpe 2.18, Calmar 3.68, and standard deviation of 50.6%" while
  the live values were **2.15, 3.60 and 50.8%**; its max drawdown read 45.4% against an actual 45.3%,
  and the Holy Grail figure it cited as 62.3% had become 62.6%. `update_metrics.py` refreshes metrics
  nightly and cannot rewrite prose, so every duplicated figure drifts silently.
- **The pilot corrects a claim the original implied.** The comparison to Holy Grail and TQQQ For The
  Long Term did not run over a shared window: `four-horsemen` is **3,677** trading days against
  **3,741** for both. The rewrite says the windows are "close rather than identical".

### Notes
- **Categories are ordered by measured frequency, not severity.** Ranking them by danger would be a
  judgement this site has no grounds to make.
- **An absent category states itself** rather than being omitted, because a missing heading cannot be
  told apart from an unwritten one.
- **Both shapes render side by side by design.** 1 strategy is an object and 30 are still strings,
  and a string renders exactly as it did before this item existed.
- **`update_metrics.py` needed no change**, verified: it mutates named fields in place and re-dumps
  the whole object, so the reshaped field survives the nightly job.
- **The validator was tested against five deliberate faults before being trusted** (mistyped key,
  missing verdict, empty category, wrong value type, null field). All five caught. A checker that has
  never failed proves nothing.
- **Verified in headless Edge** (never Chrome): the pilot renders a verdict badge and all five
  categories with no legacy box; `holy-grail` renders the legacy box and no categories; and a
  synthetic strategy carrying only two of five categories renders **5 categories, 3 marked absent,
  each with its explicit line and zero blank bodies**. That last path is not exercised by the pilot
  data, so it was tested against an injected fixture rather than left unproven.
- One test defect found and fixed: the first harness guarded the absent-category check on
  `typeof riskProfileHtml === 'function'`, which is false because the renderer is not global, so the
  check **passed by doing nothing**. Rewritten to inject a fixture between `data/strategies.js` and
  the page's own script, so the real renderer handles it.

## [1.34.1] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- **Inception dates now cover the whole library: 3,634 of 3,684 tickers, 95 KB**, up from the 105
  featured tickers shipped in v1.33.0. One unattended run of about two hours at the 2s throttle. This
  is the prerequisite for extending any inception-derived readout past the featured 31.
- **All 187 K-1 rows now carry an inception date**, up from 79 at v1.33.1. The sweep dated 185 of
  them; DBS and DBV were dated by name.
- **`refresh_ticker_inception.py` now accepts explicit tickers** (`refresh_ticker_inception.py DBS
  DBV`). Both sweeps read *held* tickers, and the K-1 database is not a subset of those, so DBS and
  DBV were unreachable by any existing flag.

### Notes
- **The 50 undated tickers were classified rather than waved through.** They are not throttling
  damage and not a bug:
  - **Delisted through acquisition or going private**, which Yahoo serves as a hard 404: K
    (Kellanova), WBA (Walgreens), ANSS (Ansys), HES (Hess), ZIMV and others.
  - **Warrants, and unfixable rather than a symbol-mapping bug.** Composer writes them `IONQ/WS`,
    which normalises to `IONQ-WS` and 404s. The correct Yahoo symbol `IONQ-WT` **resolves and still
    returns `firstTradeDate: null`**, so correcting the suffix would recover zero dates. Checked
    directly before deciding not to fix it.
- **Every consumer already degrades correctly on a missing date**, which is why 50 gaps need no
  special handling: `k1.html` omits the row, and the backtest-window card suppresses itself when any
  holding is undated rather than computing a floor from a subset.
- The run finished at 02:12 UTC against an 02:18 estimate derived from a measured rate of 27.1
  tickers/min, and checkpointed every 50 tickers throughout. It never needed resuming.

## [1.34.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Assets section on strategy pages** (closes V1.20 item 6). What the logic can reach against what
  it is holding today, from the two halves of `last_market_days_holdings`: its keys are the reachable
  universe, its values are the last market day's position. Each row carries the ticker linked to its
  K-1 entry, a proportional bar, the share, the fund's inception date, and a K-1 or ETN badge.
- **`holdings_inception` in `data/strategy_extras.json`**, the inception date for each strategy's own
  tickers. A few hundred entries across the 31 rather than shipping the whole inception file to the
  browser. The join grows from 33 KB to 46 KB.

### Changed
- **Shipped as a plain section, not the tab the roadmap specified** (owner ruling). `strategies.html`
  is one continuous scroll with no tab state anywhere on it, so reusing `.db-tabs` would have hidden
  the new content behind a click, added `?tab=` deep-link handling, and shortened a page that is not
  too long.
- **Percentages only, never the stored values** (owner ruling). `last_market_days_holdings` holds
  **aggregate dollars across Composer**, not weights: `four-horsemen` reads $229,544,631 and
  `super-semiconductors` reads $417,186. That is not the reader's money. Normalised, the same numbers
  are the strategy's own allocation, which is what a reader is asking about.

### Notes
- **The gap the section exists to show is bigger than expected.** Median universe **6 tickers**,
  median position **1**, and **not one of the 31 holds its full universe**. `super-semiconductors`
  can reach **31 tickers and is holding SMH alone**. The Deeper Metrics note already had to warn that
  the Herfindahl index describes the backtest rather than today's position; this is where a reader
  can now see the position directly instead of inferring it from a number that disagrees with it.
- **The divide is guarded.** A strategy fully in cash would have a zero total and print `NaN%` on
  every row. None of the 31 is in that state today, which is exactly why it needed guarding rather
  than testing.
- **The not-held list is worded as capability, not abandonment.** A ticker there is one the strategy
  may buy on any rebalance, and the copy says so, because a bare "not held" list invites the opposite
  reading.
- **Verified in headless Edge** (never Chrome) on four strategies spanning the range: 6 of 25, 1 of
  31, 1 of 2 and 2 of 32, each matching the source data exactly. Bars agree with their percentages
  numerically on every row, shares sum to 100% (99.9% on `four-horsemen`, which is six values rounded
  to one decimal), singular and plural both render, the K-1 badge appears on SVXY, inception dates
  render on every row, the not-held chip counts match universe minus held, and the section renders
  ahead of the K-1 notices.
- Two failures in the first run were **test artifacts**: the browser normalises `width:100.0%` to
  `100%`, so a string comparison flagged the two single-holding strategies. Compared numerically,
  zero rows are malformed.

## [1.33.2] - 2026-08-30

### Changed
- **Renamed the K-1 lookup's "First traded" row to "Inception"** (owner request). It matches the
  `inception` field it renders and the word `data/ticker_inception.json` and V1.20 item 9 already
  use, so the page and the data now say the same thing. Label only: no data, schema or logic change.

## [1.33.1] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **The K-1 lookup now shows when a fund started trading**, as a "First traded" row in the facts
  block on `k1.html`, between Structure and Tax form. Both are facts about what the fund is, and they
  read together ahead of the tax facts that follow.
- **`scripts/refresh_k1.py --inception-only`**, which joins `data/ticker_inception.json` into
  `k1.json` and exits without fetching anything.

### Changed
- **`k1.html` does not load `data/ticker_inception.js`; the date is joined into `k1.json` at build
  time.** That file reaches roughly 100 KB once it covers the whole database, and the page needs one
  date out of it, so loading it would charge every visitor 100 KB to render about 25 bytes. Joined
  in, it costs about 4.7 KB on a 69 KB file and adds no second request. Same argument and same answer
  as v1.33.0 gave for not building the backtest-window readout on `prices.json`.

### Notes
- **`--inception-only` is a separate path rather than a step in the normal run, on purpose.** A bare
  `refresh_k1.py` refetches anything older than 180 days, so hanging the join off that path would
  have meant refreshing a date could start a crawl of 187 etfdb fund pages as a side effect. The flag
  saves only when something changed and is idempotent: a second run reports 0.
- **An undated ticker carries no `inception` key and the page omits the row**, rather than storing an
  explicit null and rendering a blank value. "Nobody has looked this up" and "this fund has no start
  date" are different claims, and a missing key is not evidence for either.
- **185 of the 187 K-1 tickers are held by at least one symphony**, so the full inception sweep
  reaches them as a side effect of covering held tickers. **DBS and DBV are held by nothing** and need
  an explicit by-name fetch: the K-1 database is not a subset of the held-ticker universe, and this
  join is the place that assumption would break quietly.
- **Verified in headless Edge** (never Chrome) on three tickers: UVXY renders 6 facts including
  "First traded 2011-10-04", AGQ renders 2008-12-04, and USO, not yet dated, renders **5 facts with
  no blank row**.
- Shipped with 79 of 187 dated, because the full inception refresh was still running. The join is
  additive and idempotent, so the remaining rows fill in on a rerun rather than needing rework.

## [1.33.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Backtest-window explainer on strategy pages** (closes V1.20 item 9). A third card in Beyond the
  Backtest giving the window's length, the earliest date it could have started, and the holding that
  sets that date: "14.9 yrs, earliest possible start 2011-10-04", limited by UVXY.
- **`data/ticker_inception.json` and `.js`**, one true first-trade date per ticker, written by the
  new `scripts/refresh_ticker_inception.py` from Yahoo's `meta.firstTradeDate` and joined at build
  time by `build_strategy_extras.py`. **105 of 105 featured tickers dated, in 2 KB.** Inception dates
  do not change, so it is fetched once and refreshed rarely. Runs are additive, so extending it to
  the full database later grows the file instead of replacing it.

### Changed
- **The card does not say what the roadmap specified it should say, because measurement contradicted
  the premise.** The spec asked for "14.8 years, limited by UVXY" on every strategy, which presumes
  the limiting holding explains the window's length. Across all 31 featured strategies: **not one
  backtest starts before its floor**, so the bound is real, but **not one starts at it either**. 18
  of 31 begin within a year of the floor, where the holding genuinely explains the window. The other
  13 begin well after, up to **5.6 years late**. The specified sentence would have asserted a false
  cause on 13 of 31, so the copy switches on the measured headroom, and the second branch says the
  more useful thing: the start date was chosen, and start dates are among the easiest things to fit
  a result to.
- **`prices.json` was the specified data source and was not used.** It starts at 2010-01-04, so
  **48 of its 72 tickers report that date as their first close** because it is the file's own start
  date rather than theirs. It cannot tell "listed in 2010" from "listed in 1993": SPY would have
  been reported as starting 2010 when it launched 1993-01-29, and QQQ as 2010 when it launched
  1999-03-10. Hedging the copy with "at least" does not repair a date that is off by 17 years.
- **Corrected a stale figure in V1.20 item 9 itself.** It claimed `prices.json` "covers 72 of the 105
  tickers the featured strategies hold". That conflated *72 tickers in the file* with *72 of the
  105*. The real overlap is **44 of 105**: 28 of the file's tickers are Signal Miner universe entries
  the featured strategies never touch.

### Fixed
- **`datetime.fromtimestamp` raises `[Errno 22] Invalid argument` on Windows for a negative epoch**,
  and Yahoo returns a negative `firstTradeDate` for anything listed before 1970. KO is the featured
  set's only pre-1970 ticker (-252322200, 1962-01-02) and it failed exactly this way on the first
  run, reported as a fetch failure, which reads like a network problem rather than a date-handling
  bug. Replaced with epoch arithmetic on `timedelta`, which has no such floor on any platform.
  **Caught on 1 ticker of 105; across the full database it would have silently dropped every legacy
  stock.**

### Notes
- **Adding the 61 missing tickers to `prices.json` was considered and rejected** (owner question).
  It fixes the coverage gap but not the 2010 floor, and it charges the cost to the wrong page:
  `prices.json` exists for Signal Miner, +61 tickers is roughly +1.9 MB on every Signal Miner load
  for tickers its universe does not use, and this feature needs **one date per ticker (~25 bytes),
  not 4,188 closes (~32 KB)**. `strategies.html` also loads no price data today, so it would have
  added a multi-megabyte dependency to a page carrying a 30 KB join.
- **Ties are kept rather than collapsed to one ticker.** Whole leveraged families launched on the
  same day (SOXL and SOXS both 2010-03-11, GDXU and GDXD both 2020-12-03), so picking one would
  change between rebuilds for no reason a reader could see.
- **Incomplete coverage suppresses the card rather than guessing.** One undated holding could be the
  true floor, so a floor computed from a subset would be silently too early. `dated` and `total` are
  carried in the join and the card renders only when they agree. All 31 featured strategies have
  complete coverage today; the build reports any that do not.
- Headroom is computed in the browser, like the out-of-sample panel, so it does not go stale a day
  after the build.
- **Verified in headless Edge** (never Chrome) against all 31 featured strategies: 31 floors present,
  **0 with a backtest starting before its floor**, 0 malformed, an 18/13 split between the two copy
  branches, and three pages rendered end to end covering both branches. QQQ reads 1999-03-10 on
  `ob-os-staple-bonds`, the date `prices.json` would have reported as 2010-01-04.

## [1.32.3] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- **The database modal now traps focus** (closes open risk 8, the largest known gap against the
  WCAG 2.1 AA target). Focus moves to the close button on open, Tab and Shift+Tab wrap within the
  panel, focus that ends up outside is recaptured, and focus returns to the triggering element on
  close. `aria-labelledby="modal-title"` added so the dialog is announced with its own heading.
- **`#nav-root`, `.page` and `#footer-root` are set `inert` while the modal is open.** A focus trap
  alone stops Tab but does not stop a screen reader user browsing past the modal into the 6,547
  rows behind it. `inert` removes the background from the accessibility tree as well as the tab
  order.

### Changed
- **Corrected a stale claim in the risk register and in DESIGN.md.** Both said the modal "sets no
  `role="dialog"` / `aria-modal="true"`". It always set both, at `database.html` line 101. The real
  defect was that those attributes were **unbacked**: `aria-modal="true"` promises assistive
  technology that the rest of the page is unreachable, and it was fully reachable. That is worse
  than omitting the attribute, because the markup asserted something false rather than saying
  nothing. Recorded rather than quietly reworded.

### Notes
- **Caught by verification, before shipping: the focusable-element query collected 47 elements, 44
  of them symphony links in the table behind the modal.** `'#modal-overlay ' + 'button, [href],
  ...'` scopes only the first clause of a selector list and leaves every other clause global. The
  forward wrap then tried to focus a nav link that `inert` had just made unfocusable and silently
  did nothing. Each clause is now scoped individually; the query collects 3.
- Verified in headless Edge (never Chrome) after the fix: focus lands on the close button and
  inside the overlay, both wrap directions work with the default prevented, escaped focus is
  recaptured, all three background regions go inert and clear again on close, focus is restored to
  the triggering element, and the Tab handler is a no-op while the modal is closed.
- `database.html` is the only page on the site with a modal, so this is a single-page fix with no
  shared component to update.

## [1.32.2] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Screener CSV export** (closes the V1.12 roadmap item, open since the Screener shipped). Two
  buttons in the Screener toolbar, by owner ruling when asked to pick one form:
  - **Export view .csv** writes the active column view (Overview, Risk-Adjusted, Distribution, and
    the rest) plus `symphony_id` and the Composer URL, so any row can be traced back.
  - **Export all fields .csv** writes every scalar field the database holds, 31 columns.
  - Both export the **whole filtered set, not the visible page**. The page shows 20 rows; a typical
    filtered set is thousands. Exporting the page would have missed the point of a screener.
  - Values are **raw** (`0.4264`), never display-formatted (`42.64%`). A percent sign turns the cell
    into text the moment it opens in a spreadsheet.
  - Filenames encode the view, the row count and the date, so two exports do not overwrite each
    other in a downloads folder.
  - `screenerCsv()` builds the text and returns it; `csvDownload()` puts it on disk. Split
    deliberately, so the build half is testable from the console without fighting the browser's
    download plumbing, which is how this was verified.

### Fixed
- **Caught during verification, before shipping: the all-fields export wrote the literal string
  `[object Object]` for `last_market_days_holdings`.** The column list decided scalar-ness from the
  first row carrying a key, and that field is `null` on some rows and a map on others, so a
  first-row `null` admitted it and every populated row then exported the placeholder. **This is the
  same class of bug `export_summary.py` shipped at v1.25.1**, which derived its column list from
  entry zero. Now a two-pass scan: collect the key order, and separately exclude any key seen
  holding an object anywhere.

### Notes
- **Verified in headless Edge** (never Chrome) against the real 6,547-row working pool, by splicing
  a driver into a throwaway copy of `database.html`:
  - Both modes export **6,547 data rows**, confirming the whole filtered set rather than the page.
  - 12 columns for the Overview view, 31 for all-fields.
  - **Zero ragged rows in either mode**, including the **616 symphonies whose names contain a
    comma**. This is the check that would have caught a naive `join(',')`.
  - Every cell in the six numeric Overview columns parses as a plain number, roughly 39,000 cells,
    zero exceptions.
  - A comma-bearing name round-trips through a real quote-aware parser back to exactly 12 fields.
  - **7 unranked rows export blank rather than zero**, matching how the table renders them. Zero is
    a score; blank is an absence.
- Two apparent failures in the first test run were **test artifacts, not defects**, and are recorded
  so the next reader does not re-chase them: the percent signs the test flagged are inside symphony
  *names* (616 of them carry strings like `258.9%/42.2%DD`), not in any formatted number, and the
  `&amp;` in the sampled name is `--dump-dom` escaping the driver's own `textContent`.

## [1.32.1] - 2026-08-30

### Changed
- **Type hints removed from all Python scripts** (closes open item 12), by owner ruling. Fifteen
  `def` signatures across `update_metrics.py`, `refresh_prices.py` and `refresh_rsi.py` lost their
  parameter and return annotations. There were no `typing` imports and no variable annotations in
  function bodies, so nothing else moved. The codebase is now 0 of 24, stated rather than described.
  - **This reversed a standing instruction**, which is why it is recorded rather than quietly done.
    The Python conventions table in PRD Section 21 said of these same annotations: "Do not 'restore
    consistency' by stripping them; do not mass-add them either." That sentence described the
    situation accurately and resolved nothing. It turned a coin flip into a convention and left every
    future script's author with the same choice and no guidance. The row now states the position.
  - **One incidental effect.** `refresh_prices.py` used `tuple[list, dict]`, built-in generic syntax
    requiring Python 3.9+. Removing it widens the version floor slightly. Nothing depended on that
    floor and the workflows pin `python-version: '3.x'`, so this changes nothing today, but it is the
    only behavioural difference in an otherwise cosmetic change.
  - **Verification is weaker than usual and worth naming.** All 24 scripts pass `py_compile` and the
    four deploy gates pass, but these three scripts all make live network calls and were not
    executed. Annotation removal cannot change runtime behaviour in Python, which is the argument
    that this is safe; it is not the same as having run them.

## [1.32.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Roadmap V4.2: Feature Triage Against Comparable Tools.** Owner request: add the features of two
  third-party products to the roadmap, renamed, excluding anything that breaks the site's rules.
  Reviewed from screenshots of **Crescendo Suite**'s 16-tool launcher and **ICDB**'s free, free-
  sign-in and paid feature tiers. Neither product was run.
  - **27 features triaged** into Ship, Have, Trim and Reject, each renamed to describe the thing
    rather than echo a competitor's branding, with effort and blockers recorded.
  - **Six rejected outright on the no-accounts rule**: live account performance, Composer API
    integration, account allocation preview, cross-device sync, community search analytics, and an
    API-key settings pane. Three more **trimmed** rather than rejected, keeping the accountless half:
    preferences without device sync, a saved shelf without public sharing, and watchlists stored only
    in `localStorage`.
  - **AI-powered search trimmed to its precomputed form.** A query-time model call means a server, a
    secret and a per-query cost, breaking three rules at once. Offline generation of a keyword and
    synonym index, shipped static and searched in the browser, keeps most of the value and breaks
    none, and `add_ai_summary.py` already establishes the offline-generation pattern.
  - **Highest-value new items identified:** Version Compare (appears independently in both products,
    needs no stored data, and `converter.html` already has the renderer), Light Mode (the site has
    zero `prefers-color-scheme` and zero `data-theme` rules today, so it is dark-only), Correlation
    Grid, Path Spread and Substitute Finder.
  - **Recorded that three independent products have converged on overfit detection** (Crescendo's
    IOTA, ICDB's paid OverGuard, and Atlas's own V2.4), and that Atlas is ahead rather than behind,
    because V2.4 rests on a measurement over 5,095 symphonies untouched for at least 365 days. That
    measurement already **ruled out one of the factors a competitor advertises**: top-5%-day
    contribution scored -0.065 and was unstable, positive in only 4 of 10 in-sample-return deciles,
    while annualised turnover scored -0.316 consistently across all ten. The recommendation is to
    ship V2.4 with its measurements published, since the differentiator is not the feature but being
    able to show which factors were tested and which failed.
  - **Recorded that V1.20 item 16 (store per-strategy daily returns) now blocks eight roadmap
    entries** across V2.2, V4.0, V4.1 and V4.2, making it the highest-leverage item on the roadmap,
    and the one that is neither hard nor speculative since the refresh pipeline already receives the
    data.

## [1.31.2] - 2026-08-30

### Changed
- **`LICENSE` is now `LICENSE.md`** (closes open item 26). Moved with `git mv` so history follows the
  file, and converted to real markdown: `##` headings per section, bold on the copyright line and the
  two load-bearing sentences, an autolink on the GitHub issues URL, and an in-document link from the
  "one permission is granted" line to the section that grants it. **The wording is unchanged.** Only
  formatting moved, deliberately: the file is a legal instrument and a reflow is not the place to
  reword one. The single inbound link in `README.md` was updated. GitHub recognises `LICENSE`,
  `LICENSE.md` and `LICENSE.txt` equally, so the repo sidebar is unaffected.
- **Python path and shebang conventions unified** (closes open item 11), resolved in favour of the
  older form because it was both the majority and the better one: `pathlib` states intent that
  `os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))` only implies.
  - The original note's count was off, which the fix surfaced: it is **24 scripts, not 20**. Five
    carried no shebang and those same five used `os.path`, plus a sixth holdout the note missed,
    `add_ai_summary.py`, which had the shebang but not `pathlib`. All six converted; all 24 now carry
    `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
  - Two deliberate exceptions are documented so they are not "fixed" later.
    `measure_throughput.py` keeps `import os` for `os.sep` and `os.remove`, which are not path
    construction. `check_html_js.py` wraps `root.glob('*.html')` in `str()`, because its reporter
    concatenates the path into a message and a bare `WindowsPath` raises `TypeError` there. **That
    one was caught by running the gate, not by reading the diff**, which is the argument for running
    all four gates after a change this mechanical.
- **The `.j-*` JSON highlighter moved to `css/main.css`** (closes open item 10), removed from the
  inline stylesheets of both `converter.html` and `etf-cloner.html`. The standing position was to
  leave it until a third page needed it, on the grounds that it had not drifted. Reversed on owner
  instruction, and the reasoning holds up: two byte-identical copies is already the condition that
  position was guarding against, and the cost of being wrong about a third page is a handful of
  unused bytes.

### Notes
- **Open item 12 (type hints) was deliberately left open** rather than closed alongside 10 and 11.
  Item 11 had a right answer available without the owner: an 18-to-6 majority and a mechanical
  conversion with no judgement in it. Item 12 has no majority to follow, and the two directions cost
  real work in opposite directions. Recorded with a recommendation (remove them, matching the
  21-script majority and the absence of any tool that reads them) for a one-word ruling.

## [1.31.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- **The two automated refresh workflows manufactured the exact staleness the fourth deploy gate
  exists to catch, and thereby blocked the deploy.** `refresh-full-database.yml` rewrites
  `database.json` weekly and `update-metrics.yml` rewrites `strategies.json` nightly. Both are inputs
  to the build-time join in `data/strategy_extras.json`, and neither workflow rebuilt it, so every
  run committed fresh source data against a stale derived artifact. `deploy.yml` runs
  `check_strategy_extras.py` as a gate, so the result was a **failing GitHub Pages deploy**, not
  merely a failing local check.
  - Observed for real: the weekly refresh landed as `e2dc066` on 2026-08-30 and left `main` failing
    the gate. It was caught by hand during unrelated documentation work, not by anything designed to
    catch it, and it would have recurred every Sunday and every night.
  - Both workflows now run `scripts/build_strategy_extras.py` and commit
    `data/strategy_extras.json` and `data/strategy_extras.js` alongside their existing outputs.
  - Each workflow keeps its own failure philosophy rather than being flattened to one rule.
    `update-metrics.yml` runs the rebuild **before** its commit step with no `if: always()`, so a
    genuine join miss (a featured strategy with no database row, which is a human configuration
    error) stops the job and ships nothing, and the next daily run retries because
    `update_metrics.py` is idempotent and staleness-driven. `refresh-full-database.yml` runs it with
    `if: always()`, matching its surrounding steps, so a join miss turns the job red without
    discarding the hours of checkpointed refresh progress that workflow is built to protect.
  - `data/strategy_extras.json`/`.js` regenerated against the refreshed database (31 of 31 featured
    strategies joined, 0 misses) in `bc1eff6`.

### Changed
- **Revised the v1.28.0 decision to keep the join rebuild out of `update-metrics.yml`**, with the
  reasoning recorded rather than overwritten. The original call distinguished nothing between a join
  *miss* and a *stale* join. A miss is a human error and belongs at that human's desk, which is what
  the decision protected. A stale join has no person at any desk: it is produced by unattended jobs
  legitimately changing values the join depends on. The original reasoning was sound for the failure
  it imagined and blind to the one that occurred.
- **Documented `k1.json` as the remaining hole, deliberately.** It is the third join input and no
  workflow touches it, because `refresh_k1.py` is hand-run. That path still depends on remembering,
  exactly like the manual `database.json` routes in risk 5. The deploy gate is the backstop for both.

## [1.31.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Roadmap V4.1: Synthetic Backtester (Extreme Future State).** Owner request: a tool that accepts a
  pasted Composer symphony and backtests it locally against historical data, substituting calculated
  series for tickers that did not exist yet. Documented against four screenshots of **Crescendo
  Suite v4438c863**, a third-party desktop application supplied as the reference. Nothing was run and
  nothing is verified against that application.
  - **Decoded the Backtest Limiters table**, which is unlabelled in the reference UI. `Available From`
    is each ticker's synthetic inception and the run starts at the latest of them (confirmed: the
    report period begins 2006-02-21, exactly the top row's date). `Extension` is the trading days the
    backtest would gain by removing that one ticker, verified by arithmetic against the gap to the
    next row at 252 trading days per year, with five of ten gaps landing exactly and the rest within
    about one percent. It is a marginal-cost-of-inclusion readout, and it is cheap to build because
    it derives entirely from per-ticker start dates.
  - **Recorded two consequences of that table.** Limiters include signal-only tickers, not just held
    ones (the capture lists 2 holdings and 15 limiters), so a ticker read in a condition and never
    bought still truncates the backtest. And the `Synthetic | Real Data` divider sits near 2022 while
    limiters reach to 1926, consistent with the boundary being set by the newest input, meaning one
    2020-vintage ETF can convert roughly fifteen years of a backtest into modelled data.
  - **Recorded the finding that matters most:** in the captured report every severe drawdown falls in
    the synthetic era (top four all pre-2016, nothing comparable after the divider), so the headline
    max drawdown, longest-drawdown, Calmar and worst-year figures are properties of modelled history
    presented identically to measured history. Set as a hard requirement on anything Atlas builds
    here: mark synthetic-derived figures at the point of display, not only on a chart divider.
  - **Scoped what is tractable.** Leveraged and inverse daily-reset funds are reconstructible from an
    unleveraged parent plus a financing rate, which covers much of what the library actually holds
    (UPRO alone is held by 2,271 symphonies). Everything else is not: proxying sector and style funds
    needs licensed academic data, and the 3,680-ticker tail is unreachable by any proxy scheme.
  - **Noted two ideas worth pursuing independently and far more cheaply than this item:** symphony
    version-hash pinning, which would let `oos_date` be detected exactly rather than inferred, and
    benchmark comparison on strategy pages, which Atlas does not show at all today.
  - Cross-referenced to the shared daily-equity-curve schema gap (V1.20 item 16) now blocking three
    separate items, to V2.4 Overfit Check (whose verdict must not be computed from synthetic data),
    to V1.20 item 9's inception wording, and to the V4.0 architectural blockers.
  - Also recorded an inference, marked as unconfirmed: the 1926-07-15 floor matches the Ken French
    data library start and 1962 the conventional CRSP daily start, suggesting sector and style ETFs
    are proxied by Fama-French portfolios. The 1938 cluster is unexplained. Establishing the true
    source is listed as the first task, because it decides whether the approach is redistributable.

## [1.30.7] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **PRD Section 14: "External Data and Library Resources"**, a reference-only subsection recording
  two sources found during research, neither adopted and neither a roadmap item.
  - **HF Data Library** (`hfdatalibrary.com`) as a candidate future source for `data/prices.json`:
    1-minute OHLCV back to 2002 across a stated 1,391-ticker universe, Parquet/CSV, REST plus MCP
    access, free key at 100 downloads/minute, ~13 GB for the full universe. Cross-referenced to the
    two places the current 72-ticker ceiling is already a documented blocker (V2.4 Overfit Check
    Tier 3 at 16.7% coverage, and V1.20 item 9's "at least" inception wording). Six counterweights
    recorded alongside it so it is not revisited as a solved problem: 1,391 still does not reach the
    3,680 tickers the library holds, 1-minute granularity is three orders of magnitude finer than
    anything here uses, ~13 GB has no home on a static site, it adds an API-key dependency price
    data does not currently have, adjusted closes are not among the stated columns, and the
    redistribution terms have not been read.
  - **`ranaroussi/quantstats`** as the Python upstream of `quantstats-js`, already listed as
    candidate fork 4 in V4.0. Recorded as the reference implementation to check formulas against
    rather than a candidate in its own right, since only the JS port could run in the browser, and
    noted as sharing the port's blocking gap: both need a daily equity-curve series that
    `database.json` does not store (V1.20 item 16).

### Changed
- **Permission requests route to GitHub issues.** `LICENSE` and `README.md` now direct permission
  requests to `https://github.com/Azqato/composer/issues` rather than azqato.com, so requests and
  their answers are public by default. (Shipped in v1.30.6, recorded here.)
- **Roadmap open item 26 added:** convert `LICENSE` to a markdown file. GitHub recognises `LICENSE`,
  `LICENSE.md` and `LICENSE.txt` equally, so this is a `git mv` plus the one README link.
  (Shipped in v1.30.6, recorded here.)

## [1.30.5] - 2026-08-28

### AI and search referencing explicitly permitted

**Owner decision, 2026-08-28.** The one permission granted up front in an otherwise
grants-nothing licence.

Search engines, AI assistants and answer engines may **crawl, index, store for retrieval, quote,
summarise, link to and cite** the site and this repository. Attribution is requested rather than
required, and no permission needs to be asked for.

**This does not weaken the reservation shipped in v1.30.4.** That file grants nothing so the owner
can enforce selectively against someone who republishes the site. Referencing is the one use that
costs the project nothing and gains it distribution: being cited in an AI answer is the modern
equivalent of ranking, and the site exists to be read. Enforcing against a citation would be working
against the site's own purpose.

**The line is drawn at referencing against substitution and training.** The grant does not cover
reproducing the site as a substitute for visiting it, and does not by itself grant training-data
rights, which stay on the ordinary request route and are noted as not usually refused. The split is
deliberate: **retrieval-and-cite is what actually produces the citations**, and it does not require
handing over a training licence to get them. Widening it later is one sentence; narrowing a granted
right is not.

**Nothing about the site's behaviour changed.** `robots.txt` already carried `User-agent: *` /
`Allow: /`, so every AI crawler was already permitted. What changed is that the intent is now stated
in both places: a comment in `robots.txt` marks the permission deliberate so a future tightening is
a decision rather than an accident, and the licence is named as authoritative if the two ever
disagree.

**Files changed:** `LICENSE`, `robots.txt`, `README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.30.4] - 2026-08-28

### Licence made explicit: all rights reserved, by decision rather than by default

**Owner decision, 2026-08-28: the code is all rights reserved and MIT was never wanted.** Closes
open risk #4, which had sat as "owner decision needed".

**Nothing was legally wrong before this.** The README's MIT assertion had already been removed when
the README was rewritten, so the repository asserted no licence and the legal default, all rights
reserved, was already in force. This release changes the state from correct-but-implicit to
correct-and-stated. A reader seeing no `LICENSE` cannot tell a deliberate reservation from an
oversight, and many assume an unlicensed repository is free to use.

**A correction to how this was reported.** It was raised in a roadmap summary as "README asserts
MIT, repo has no LICENSE", which was wrong: that reading came from risk #4's past-tense wording
rather than from the README, and the MIT claim had been gone for some time. Verified against
`README.md`, `about.html`, the rendered footer and the whole repository: no MIT claim existed
anywhere.

**The licence grants nothing, and that is deliberate.** The owner's goal is not to stop people
copying the site: it is to **reserve the ability to enforce against someone they object to**. Those
two goals conflict if the licence hands out permissions, because a permission granted to everyone
cannot easily be withdrawn from one person. **A first draft granted quoting and excerpting rights
and was rewritten to grant nothing**, so every use is tolerated rather than licensed, and stays
actionable.

**The clause doing the real work is NO WAIVER.** Choosing not to act against one use is expressly
not a licence, not a precedent, and not a waiver against that person or anyone else, and delay in
enforcing does not waive. Without it, a long history of tolerating copying is the first thing an
infringer would point at. Permission is available on request instead, and is scoped to the purpose
and person it names.

**Two things it deliberately does not claim.**

- **It does not purport to override GitHub's Terms of Service**, which give other GitHub users
  rights to view and fork any public repository. The file records that those operate independently
  and are not enlarged by it, rather than pretending to withhold them.
- **It does not claim the data.** `data/` holds material derived from the Composer.trade API and
  from public market data, which is not the copyright holder's to license, and the file says so.

**Residual, and it is a property of the medium.** The site is a static front end, so its HTML, CSS
and JS are served to every visitor in readable form by necessity. The licence changes the
permission, not the visibility. That was already true and is unrelated to this decision.

**Files changed:** `LICENSE` (new), `README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.30.3] - 2026-08-28

### Overfit Check renumbered to V2.4, and the session's measurements written down in full

Documentation only, no site change. Two owner instructions: sequence the tool later, and make sure
everything from the session actually reached the documentation.

**Renumbered V1.21 to V2.4** and physically moved after V2.3 in Section 14, so the ordering is
unambiguous rather than implied by a number sitting next to the phase currently in progress. The
milestone table row moved with it.

**It is explicitly not blocked on V2.3.** The community-signals form is last for its own unrelated
reasons, and a numbering adjacency should not invent a dependency. The real prerequisites are
recorded instead: V1.20 finished or at least past the item 19 gate, since this tool renders the same
kind of quantitative disclosure that phase is still settling; the Tier 2 validation project, without
which two of three tiers are unvalidated; and the V4.0 architecture decision for Tier 3 only, which
may never come. **Nothing in the research expires**, so the delay costs only the tool not existing.

**An audit found the respecification had dropped a dozen measured findings.** Rewriting the section
around the definitional framing in v1.30.2 replaced rather than merged, and the earlier
distributional work went with it. All of it is now restored under a new **Measurements, in full**
appendix, so the numbers survive in the roadmap and not only in this changelog:

- **Return concentration across the database.** Full percentile table, plus the fact that **80.6% of
  symphonies exceed 100%** and 45.8% exceed 150%. This gives the metric a **second** independent
  reason not to carry a verdict: it fires on four symphonies in five, and separately it fails the
  prediction test. Median best single day 4.7%, best 10% of days 209.6%, kurtosis 17.0.
- **Backtest length.** Median 3,172 days; **23.2% under five years, 3.4% under two.**
- **Time since last logic edit.** Median **758 days**; 79.3% at least a year, 53.1% two, 28.0% three.
- **A second control**, predicting the raw out-of-sample outcome instead of the gap. Win rate is the
  best single field at rho +0.232, return concentration -0.126. **Everything is weak in absolute
  terms, which is itself the result:** no stored field comes close to predicting next year, and the
  within-decile test should not be oversold either.
- **The diversification confound**, with its full table. Concurrent holdings appear to improve every
  metric, but the diversified cohort has half the backtest length and Sharpe by window is not
  monotonic. A tool rewarding diversification would be scoring the sample period.
- **Tier 3 ticker coverage**, with the full breakdown and the most-held uncovered names: UPRO
  (2,271 symphonies), VIXY (1,669), TECS (1,172), UGL (1,057), ERX (969).

Verified by search: every figure quoted in the session now appears in the V2.4 section, and no stale
`V1.21` reference remains anywhere in `docs/PRD.md`. The v1.30.1 and v1.30.2 entries below still say
V1.21 and are left alone, because they record what was true when written.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.30.2] - 2026-08-28

### V1.21 respecified: overfitting measured against its definition, not against peers

Documentation only, no site change. **Supersedes the framing shipped in v1.30.1 a few hours
earlier**, at the owner's direction.

**The correction.** v1.30.1 built the tool on percentile ranking: your symphony's return
concentration is worse than 91% of the 6,324 measured. The owner rejected that, on the grounds that
the tool is meant to determine whether a symphony is overfit **by definition**, not to rank it
against its peers. That is right, and testing it afterwards showed the rejected design was worse
than philosophically off.

**Overfitting is fitting noise, and the test is survival out of sample.** `oos_date` records the
last logic edit and covers 6,470 of 6,472 usable rows, so the procedure is runnable here. **5,095
symphonies have gone at least a year without an edit:**

- Median backtested annual return **49.4%**, median actual out-of-sample year **17.6%**
- **Only 22.2% delivered at least their backtest.** 39.1% delivered half. 77.9% were merely positive
- **The typical symphony delivers about a third of its backtested annual return once its author
  stops editing it**

Stated with its limitation: this is out of sample with respect to *editing*, not a clean data
holdout. It catches the author who tweaked until the curve looked right, which is the dominant way a
Composer symphony gets overfit, and misses one overfitted in a single pass and never touched.

**A flag is only useful if it predicts degradation, so every candidate was tested.** The naive
version is a trap: correlating a flag with (out-of-sample minus in-sample) is partly tautological,
and run raw, in-sample return "predicts" degradation at r = -0.904, which is regression to the mean
wearing a lab coat. Controlling by scoring within in-sample-return deciles:

| Flag | Mean within-decile rho | Consistent | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Annualized turnover** | **-0.316** | 10 of 10 | strongest in the database |
| Backtest length | +0.188 | 9 of 10 | real, weaker |
| Win rate | +0.185 | 9 of 10 | real, weaker |
| Sharpe ratio | +0.080 | sign flips | too weak |
| **Return from the best 5% of days** | **-0.065** | **sign flips** | **does not predict** |

**The metric the request named, and the one V1.20 item 4 ships, does not predict out-of-sample
failure.** That does not make item 4 wrong, since outlier dependence is a true statement about what
a backtest rests on. It makes it the wrong basis for an overfit verdict. **The rejected percentile
design would have ranked symphonies precisely, on a measure that predicts nothing.**

**Turnover is the finding, and nobody reaches for it when asked about overfitting.** The lowest
quintile is the only cohort that kept its backtest (17.1% promised, 18.5% delivered); the highest
promised 153.9% a year and delivered 3.8%. **Caveat carried alongside it:** high turnover also
degrades returns through costs and slippage, which is mechanical drag rather than curve fitting, and
this data cannot separate the two.

**What did not replicate:** short backtests, the classic tell, had the *smallest* median gap in raw
data because they also promised least. Length only predicts after controlling for in-sample return.

**On whether AI can spot a random signal**, the owner's second question, answered directly. Not from
the rule text: whether `RSI(10) of SMH < 23` is real or noise is a property of the rule-data
relationship, not of the sentence, and the information is absent from the input. A model asked
anyway returns confident nothing, which is the false authority this tool exists to puncture. What AI
can add is a **prior about mechanism**, labelled as a prior and never blended into the statistics.
The rigorous answer is a multiple-testing correction, and **the Signal Miner's 4.8M-signal sweep can
supply an empirical null** rather than an analytic approximation, which ties this to Signal Miner
item A. Note also that a static site has no live model call, so any AI read would be offline-authored
like `ai_summary`, not available for an arbitrary paste.

The three tiers were rebuilt around this: Tier 1 the definitional test (validated against 5,095 real
outcomes), Tier 2 the structural read of the pasted tree (**explicitly unvalidated**, and validating
it is called out as its own project), Tier 3 parameter perturbation (blocked at 16.7% ticker
coverage).

## [1.30.1] - 2026-08-28

### V1.21 added to the roadmap: Overfit Check

Documentation only, no site change. Requested by the owner: a tool where you paste a symphony and it
determines whether it is overfit, from signal overfitness, return concentration in the best days,
and whatever else the research supports.

Specified as a new milestone with the research already done, because the research changes the
design rather than confirming it.

**The finding that shapes the whole tool: an absolute threshold is useless here.** Across the 6,324
database rows carrying the field, **80.6% of all symphonies get more than 100% of their total return
from their best 5% of days**, median 143.0%. The V1.20 item 4 panel found 25 of 31 for the featured
strategies and the full database agrees almost exactly. A tool flagging "above 100%" would flag four
symphonies in five and say nothing. **Every return-based measure has to be a percentile against the
database, not a threshold**, and that comparison is the tool's whole competitive position: nothing
else has 6,669 measured symphonies to paste against.

**Three tiers, by how widely each can actually run.**

*Tier A, structural, works on anything pasted.* This is the signal-overfitness half, and it is
largely built already: `converter.html` accepts a URL, ID or raw JSON, handles the Composer fetch
and CORS fallback, and walks the tree; `nodes.html` already counts nodes by type. The tool is a
third consumer of that parse, not a rebuild. Free parameters against sample length, threshold
specificity (a gate at 79 is a fitted number wearing a convention's clothes), near-duplicate
thresholds, window-length diversity, branches against distinct assets, depth.

*Tier B, return-based percentiles, works for the 6,669 rows already measured.* Every field is in
`database.json` and already joined by `scripts/build_strategy_extras.py`. Notably `oos_date` is
present on **6,470 of 6,472 usable rows**, and **23.2% of the database is backtested on under five
years, 3.4% on under two.**

*Tier C, the parameter-plateau test, is the strongest measure and is blocked.* Asking whether a rule
still works one step either side of its fitted threshold needs a re-backtest, which needs prices.
**`data/prices.json` holds 72 tickers; 3,680 distinct tickers are held across the database.** Only
**1,112 symphonies, 16.7%, hold exclusively covered tickers**, and that counts only current
holdings, so true coverage is worse. UPRO alone is held by 2,271 symphonies and is not covered.
Sequenced last, behind V1.20 item 16 and the V4.0 architecture decision, and cross-referenced to
Signal Miner item A and `composer_json_fuzz_tester`, which already does exactly this offline.

**A confound recorded so it is not rediscovered as a feature.** Concurrent holdings look like they
improve everything: median return from the best 5% of days falls from 162.7% at one holding to 94.8%
at 32 or more, while median Sharpe rises 1.33 to 2.26. But the diversified cohort has roughly **half
the backtest length** (3,728 days down to 1,832), and median Sharpe by window is not monotonic
either: 1.36 under two years, 1.60 at two to five, 1.95 at five to ten, back to 1.36 at ten or more.
**A tool rewarding a symphony for holding more things at once would be scoring the sample period.**
Related: `active_asset_nodes` is a map of currently active nodes to weights, so its length is
today's diversification and not tree size. **The database has no structural complexity field at
all**, which is exactly why the tool needs the paste rather than a lookup.

**Constraints carried in:** no server, no accounts, nothing pasted is stored or logged; **no score
out of 100**, because a composite invites the optimisation the tool exists to detect and its weights
would be unfalsifiable; every result names what it could not see.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-08-28

Roadmap V1.20 step 3: items **2, 3, 8 and 12** in one pass, on all 31 strategy pages. The visual
reorganisation of the strategy detail view, done together so the page is not restructured twice.

### Item 8: a provenance chip, and there are two of them

Above the tag row, because a visitor should know the age of a number before reading it rather than
after.

**There are genuinely two ages on this page and the chips say so**, instead of averaging them into
one reassuring date. The headline strip and the sidebar table come from `data/strategies.json` and
carry its `last_updated`. The Deeper Metrics grid, the outlier panel, the out-of-sample panel and
the K-1 and ETN notices come from the v1.28.0 build-time join and carry `data/database.json`'s
`refresh_date`. **Those two differ on all 31 strategies today**, by one to seven days.

When the dates agree the page renders a single "Data refreshed" chip, and when the join has not
loaded it renders only the one age it can honestly state. The dot turns yellow past 14 days, which
is long enough to mean the nightly refresh has stopped rather than slipped over a weekend.

### Item 2: four metrics above the fold

Annualized return, max drawdown, Sharpe and backtest period, directly under the description and
above the Open in Composer button. Two columns on a phone, four from 720px.

**The problem was structural.** The metrics table is sidebar-only on desktop and rendered below
every prose section on mobile, so the first thing a phone visitor saw was three paragraphs and no
numbers. The strip reads from `strategies.json`, which every strategy has, so unlike the rest of
V1.20 it is not guarded on the join: it renders identically whether or not `strategy_extras.js`
loaded. Verified by serving the site with both extras files deleted.

### Item 3: seven metrics that existed and were shown nowhere

A Deeper Metrics grid: Sortino, win rate, tail ratio, skewness, kurtosis, Herfindahl index and
annualized turnover. Every tile carries a one-line plain-language gloss beneath the value, which is
what makes the grid publishable rather than a wall of jargon with links attached.

**Total costs was in the spec and is deliberately not shown.** It is cumulative dollars on an
unstated notional. Across the 31 the figures run from **$19,866 to $13.2 billion**, and dividing by
`cumulative_return` gives a ratio spanning **7.3 to 3,493**, so there is no denominator anywhere on
this site that would make one strategy's costs comparable to another's. It stays carried in the join
for the day a notional is recorded, and the note under the grid says why it is absent rather than
letting it vanish quietly.

**The Herfindahl index does not describe the current position, and the note says that too.** Checked
against `last_market_days_holdings`: `super-semiconductors` stores **0.641** while its only current
holding is SMH, which would be 1.00. It arrives with the backtest statistics alongside Sortino and
turnover, so it describes the backtest. Labelling it as today's concentration would have been wrong
on at least 4 of the 31.

### Item 12: glossary links on metric labels

One map, `METRIC_GLOSSARY` in `js/app.js`, covering 13 labels and applied by `metricLabel()` to the
hero strip, the Deeper Metrics grid and the existing sidebar metrics table in a single place. **23
linked labels render on a strategy page.**

**An unmapped label stays plain text on purpose.** A link that lands on "No concept with slug" is
worse than no link, so Cumulative Return, the four Daily Distribution rows and the three Trailing
Returns rows are unlinked until the glossary defines them. The fix for a missing term is to write
the term, which is the order v1.27.8 already established when the seven metric terms were written
before anything linked to them.

The links inherit their colour and carry a dotted rule rather than the site's green link styling.
Inside a metrics table a column of green underlined text reads as navigation and pulls the eye off
the values, which are the content.

### Verification

Run locally, not against the live site. Both loading paths and both failure paths:

- **Local server and `file://`**, so the `fetch` fallback and the `.js` twin are both exercised.
- **`gold-miner-original`**, which carries every V1.20 section, and **`four-horsemen`** as a control,
  which correctly shows no TL;DR, no Assumptions and no regime table but does show the new grid.
- **Both extras files deleted**, where the page correctly drops Deeper Metrics, Beyond the Backtest
  and the holdings notices, keeps the hero strip, and falls back to a single provenance chip.
- **Mobile width at 390px**, measured before and after with `git stash`: `scrollWidth` equals
  `clientWidth` at 477 in both, so nothing here widened the document. The regime table still
  overflows its own `overflow-x` wrapper by design and nothing else does.

**Files changed:** `strategies.html`, `js/app.js`, `css/main.css`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`,
`docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.29.4] - 2026-08-28

### Item 19: a structure sign-off gate before Tier 3 expands

Documentation only, no site change. Added at the owner's request after reviewing the pilot.

**Nothing in items 13, 14 or 15 gets written for a second strategy until the structure is explicitly
approved.** The owner's verdict on the pilot was that it is good as a rough draft and needs more
organisational refinement, so the roadmap now carries a hard hold point rather than an intention.

**It sits between step 5 and the Tier 3 writing**, which is the only place it works. Earlier and
there is nothing finished to judge; later and every unresolved organisational question has already
been multiplied by thirty. Tier 3 is the one tier where that is not cheap to undo: item 10 showed a
schema change is survivable, but thirty pieces of authored prose written to the wrong shape are not.

**The gate has already earned its place before being formally run.** Two structural corrections came
out of the first informal review, both from the owner and neither anticipated: the K-1 and ETN notice
moved below Risk Profile (v1.29.1) and Market Regime Analysis moved above it (v1.29.3). Section
ordering is exactly the class of decision that is cheap to change once and expensive to change
thirty times.

Sign-off is scoped to four things, so approving it means something specific: section order and which
sections exist at all; **whether `risk_profile` survives**, given the regime table and the
Struggles-in column now overlap it; the shape and length of each section's content, where the
pilot's counts were chosen for one strategy rather than as a standard; and how much research a
regime table is allowed to require, which is the whole argument for item 16.

The sequencing renumbered to eight steps. Item 19 is recorded as the owner's, distinct from the
eight items taken from the screenshot and the ten found by auditing this site's own data.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.29.3] - 2026-08-28

### Market Regime Analysis moved above Risk Profile

Owner decision, on the `gold-miner-original` pilot. It shipped below Risk Profile in v1.29.0 and now
sits immediately before it.

**The order it lands in is the better argument.** The regime table names the conditions a strategy
meets and how it behaves in each, which is the evidence. Risk Profile is the conclusion drawn from
that evidence. Putting the table first means a reader arriving at the risk summary has already seen
what it is a summary of, rather than being given a verdict and the supporting detail afterwards.

Order on a strategy page is now TL;DR, AI Summary, How It Works, Signals and Logic, Market Regime
Analysis, Risk Profile, the K-1 and ETN notice, Underlying Assumptions, Beyond the Backtest.

**Files changed:** `strategies.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.29.2] - 2026-08-28

### V1.20 roadmap items now record where each one came from

Documentation only, no site change.

The owner's approval of this phase asked for two things at once: the sections from a screenshot they
liked, and any missing sections worth adding beyond it. Both went into the roadmap and **nothing
recorded which was which.** It was recoverable for two items, because 10 and 11 happen to mention
the screenshot in their own text, and lost for the other sixteen.

That distinction matters more than it looks. **"We took this from a page we admired" and "we found
this in our own data" are different claims, and only one of them is checkable against a source.**
Six months from now, with the screenshot long gone, an item with no provenance reads as an idea
nobody can trace.

A table in `docs/PRD.md` now tags all eighteen. **Eight came from the screenshot** (2, 3, 6, 10, 11,
13, 14, 15). **Ten came out of auditing this site's own data** (1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18),
and two of those, items 17 and 18, are bugs rather than features.

**The most differentiating item on the whole list is one the source could not have suggested.**
Item 7, the K-1 warning cross-linked to `/k1`, needs the K-1 database built in v1.19. Item 9 is the
only entry that is neither: it is an inversion of the screenshot's real-against-simulated-history
row, which was measured and found not to apply here.

## [1.29.1] - 2026-08-28

### The K-1 and ETN notice moved below Risk Profile

Owner decision. It shipped in v1.28.0 directly under the Open in Composer button, then under the
TL;DR card in v1.29.0. It now sits **after Risk Profile and before Underlying Assumptions**.

The original argument for putting it high was that a mechanical fact about holding something should
come before any description of why someone might want it. The new placement reads better for a
simple reason: **the notice is a specific risk, so it belongs in the run of risk sections** rather
than interrupting the summary of what the strategy is. A reader who has just been given the risk
profile is in the right frame to be told which holding sends a K-1. A reader who has not got there
yet is being handed a tax detail before they know what they are looking at.

Order on a strategy page is now TL;DR, AI Summary, How It Works, Signals and Logic, Risk Profile,
the K-1 and ETN notice, Underlying Assumptions, Market Regime Analysis, Beyond the Backtest.

## [1.29.0] - 2026-08-28

Roadmap V1.20 items 13, 14 and 15, **piloted on one strategy**. Requested out of sequence by the
owner, to look at the format before committing to writing it 31 times.

### One strategy, fully written: The Gold Miner (Original)

`gold-miner-original` now carries a TL;DR card, an Underlying Assumptions section and a Market Regime
Analysis table. **The other 30 strategies carry none of it** and render exactly as they did: every
section is guarded on the content existing, verified against `four-horsemen` as a control.

This is the roadmap's own instruction at its narrowest. Write one strategy fully and look at it
before deciding whether the format is worth 31 of them.

### The format earned its place, and here is the evidence

**Item 13's opposed columns worked as designed.** The Struggles-in column does not let an author
describe a strategy without naming what breaks it, and writing it surfaced something the existing
page never said: this strategy's worst case is not a down market, it is a directionless one.
**Through 2026 to 21 August, GDXU fell 23.5% and GDXD fell 81.9%** at the same time. Both leveraged
legs lost together and only GLD was up, at 6.3%. The prose sections had never been written in a
shape that would have found that.

**Item 14's split produced the sharpest line on the page.** The strategy is named and described by
its RSI(10) gates at 79 and 30. A reconstruction of the logic over real prices shows **those gates
fired on 10.6% of days**; the momentum branches made the other 89.4% of the decisions. The strategy
is known for a signal that runs about one day in ten.

Other assumptions now stated plainly: that the 2024 to 2026 gold re-rating is representative, on a
backtest of 1,363 trading days containing exactly one enormous bull market and no full commodity
bear cycle; that a 70-day and a 75-day lookback are meaningfully different, which is load-bearing
and unexplained; and that GDXU and GDXD are ETNs, so unsecured bank debt sits underneath every state
except GLD.

### The regime table is grounded, and the grounding was checked

Six regimes, each with a real example period. **Every figure is a price move over a fixed window**,
computed from `data/prices.json`, so none of it goes stale on a refresh.

The regimes were identified by reconstructing the strategy's state machine over those same closes.
**That reconstruction was verified before it was trusted:** it changes asset every 4.2 trading days
against the 60.7 annual rebalances the Composer pipeline independently reports. It is a reading of
the logic and not a backtest, carries no fees or slippage, and a footnote under the table says
exactly that. The example column reports what the holdings did, never what the strategy returned.

The findings the table records, all checkable: 2025 alone gave GDXU +695.2% while GDXD fell 97.2%;
across the 2022 hiking cycle GDXU lost 73.8% while GDXD, the leg meant to profit from precisely
that, gained only 1.4%; and GDXU lost 41.7% in the 41 trading days after the November 2024 election.

### Schema and rendering

Four optional fields on `data/strategies.json`: `tldr`, `assumptions`, `regimes` and `regime_note`.
They accept inline `**bold**` and `` `code` `` through `mdInline()`, two regexes in `js/app.js`
rather than the project's first runtime dependency.

**A rule worth stating, because it has already been broken elsewhere in this file:** numbers written
into these fields must be historical facts about fixed date windows, never restated live metrics. A
restated metric goes stale on the next refresh with nothing to catch it, which is why several
`risk_profile` and `ai_summary` strings currently quote figures their own metrics tables disagree
with. Anything that changes is rendered from the data.

The regime table keeps its example column at every width by scrolling inside its own `overflow-x`
wrapper. Verified at 390px: the wrapper scrolls internally and the document's width is unchanged
from the pre-existing 453px baseline recorded as roadmap item 18.

### Sequencing

This ran ahead of steps 3, 4 and 5. **The rework risk is smaller than the ordering implied**, because
these three items introduce their own new fields rather than editing `risk_profile` or `signals`, so
item 10's schema change cannot invalidate them. **The real exposure is overlap:** item 10 splits
`risk_profile` into named categories including Whipsaw and Signal, and this pilot now says some of
the same things in better form. When item 10 is done the question will be what `risk_profile` is
still for.

## [1.28.0] - 2026-08-28

Roadmap V1.20 items 1, 4, 5 and 7. Steps 1 and 2 of the seven-step sequencing, complete.

### The strategy pages now read a build-time join, not the raw database

`scripts/build_strategy_extras.py` joins the 31 featured strategies to `data/database.json` and
`data/k1.json` and writes `data/strategy_extras.json` plus its `.js` twin, keyed by slug.
**31 KB, against the 5 MB `database.json` a browser-side join would have shipped to every visitor.**
It carries 13 database fields and the resolved holdings, so roadmap items 2, 3, 6 and 8 need no
further build work.

**It fails loudly on a miss, and that was tested rather than asserted.** A featured strategy with no
database row raises and names every affected slug, verified by faking two bad `symphony_id` values.
`scripts/check_strategy_extras.py` is now a **fourth deploy gate**: it rebuilds the join in memory
and demands byte equality with both committed files, so it catches a stale join, a `.json`/`.js`
twin that drifted, and a missing database row. Verified failing and passing in both directions.

That twin check exists because of something found the day before: **`data/database.js` shipped one
entry behind `data/database.json` at v1.27.9 and `check_database_keys.py` passed anyway**, since it
checks keys rather than whether the twins match. Nothing enforced commit-both-or-neither for that
pair. Now something does, at least for this one.

**Deliberately not wired into `update-metrics.yml`.** A join miss should fail the person who caused
it, at their desk, rather than break the nightly metrics job and its sitemap commit for everyone.

### Outlier dependence, which was computed all along and never shown

**25 of the 31 featured strategies got more than 100% of their total return from their best 5% of
days.** Above 100% means the other 95% of days lost money on net, and the page says exactly that:
remove those days and the strategy is a net loser. The range runs from **79.4%**
(`simons-kmlm-switcher`) to **260.2%** (`nancy-pelosi-chips`).

Stated as arithmetic and left as arithmetic. No score, no badge, no rating, per the roadmap's own
instruction: the raw number is more persuasive than anything derived from it. Below 100% the copy
switches to naming what the remaining 95% of days contributed, rather than implying a problem that
is not there.

### Out-of-sample duration, from the date of the last logic edit

`oos_date` records when the logic last changed, so days since is genuine out-of-sample time.
`holy-grail` has been unedited for **1,500 days**; the 2026 zoop editions sit at **165 to 214**.

**Worded as a measurement, not a verdict.** Days after an edit are genuinely out of sample because
they were not available to be fitted to, and logic also sits untouched when nobody is maintaining
it. Both are said. `gold-miner-original` has no `oos_date`, so its panel reads "Not recorded" and
tells the reader to treat the whole backtest as in-sample until it is: hiding the panel would have
turned a missing measurement into no question at all. The day count is computed in the browser, in
UTC on both sides, so it neither goes stale a day after the build nor reads short west of Greenwich.

### Which strategies can hand you a Schedule K-1

**12 of 31 can hold a fund that issues one**, and since v1.27.9 made ETNs visible, **2 more can hold
an ETN**, so 14 strategies carry a notice. Every ticker links to its full entry at
`k1.html?t=TICKER`. Verdicts are resolved from `data/k1.json` at build time and never restated, so a
correction to the K-1 database propagates instead of going stale in a second place.

**The join forced a correction to the wording.** The keys of `last_market_days_holdings` are the
ticker universe the logic can reach; the values are the current position, and most are `0.0`. Only
**2 of those 14 strategies** hold the fund in question as of the last market day. So the pages say
"can hold", and name what is in the position separately. "Holds" would have been wrong 12 times
out of 14.

### Also found, not fixed

**Strategy detail pages scroll horizontally at a phone width, and have for some time.** At 390px the
document's `scrollWidth` is 453px against a `clientWidth` of 375px. **Measured identical before and
after this release**, so the new sections neither cause nor worsen it. Localised as far as `.grid-2`
computing to 327px wide while its single `1fr` track resolves to 429px, with `.detail-main` filling
the track despite already carrying `min-width: 0`. Recorded as roadmap item 18 rather than bundled
in here: it is unrelated to these four items, and a layout fix touching every strategy page deserves
its own change and its own before-and-after.

### Verification

Five strategies driven end to end in headless Edge, chosen to cover every branch: a K-1 holder with
one position held today, an ETN holder with no `oos_date`, the highest and the lowest outlier
dependence, and a strategy with neither notice. Section order, ticker links, both plural forms and
the degraded path (extras file absent and `fetch` failing, which must still render the original
page) all confirmed.

## [1.27.9] - 2026-08-28

### `/k1` now says when a ticker is an ETN, not a fund

Six of the 187 rows in the K-1 database are exchange-traded notes: **FNGD, FNGU, GDXD, GDXU, VXX and
VXZ.** They are among the most heavily traded tickers the site touches, and two of them are held by a
featured symphony today. Until now the page told you the least interesting true thing about them,
that they send a 1099-B.

**An ETN is not a fund.** It is senior unsecured debt of the issuing bank and a promise to pay the
index return. Nothing is held on your behalf, so there is no basket to liquidate if the issuer fails:
you are an unsecured creditor of a failed bank rather than an owner of securities. The issuer can
also call the note, suspend new issuance, or delist it, and a note trading with creations suspended
can drift far from what it tracks and stay there.

Three surfaces, deliberately different in weight:

1. **A blue callout on the answer panel**, shown whenever the structure is `ETN`. It works for live
   unverified lookups too, since that path parses the same field.
2. **An `ETN` tag** on the ticker in the fund table, so the fact shows up while scanning rather than
   only after a lookup.
3. **An `ETN` filter pill.** It cuts across the K-1 axis instead of sitting beside it: every ETN is
   also a "No", so it narrows that list rather than adding a fourth state. The CSV export follows the
   filter and names the file `composer-atlas-k1-etn-<date>.csv`.

**The callout is quieter than the contested-sources warning on purpose.** Pink means the answer on
the page may be wrong. Blue means the answer is right and a different risk sits beside it. Styling
both the same would teach a reader to skim both.

The count in the explainer paragraph is written from the database at render time rather than typed,
so it cannot go stale the next time the refresh script picks up an ETN.

No new fetching was needed. `structure` has been in the database since v1.27.0; this release only
reads it.

### New symphony: "The Golden KMLM Switch"

Processed from `data/AddSymphony.csv`. ARR 14.22, max drawdown -51.83%, Sharpe 3.168 over 1,096 days,
last logic edit 2026-08-25. The database goes 6,668 to 6,669.

Added to `storage.csv` and `database.json` by hand rather than through
`sync_storage_to_database.py`, which resurrects purged dead symphonies, then refreshed that one row
through `refresh_full_database.apply_backtest_result`. 104 other rows were past the seven-day
staleness mark; refreshing those is the weekly job.

**`data/database.js` was briefly out of sync with its JSON twin during this work** (6,668 against
6,669), because refreshing a single row bypasses the `main()` that writes the twin. It was
regenerated before the commit and the two now round-trip identical. Worth recording because
**`check_database_keys.py` passed while they disagreed**: the gate checks keys, not that the twins
match. Nothing enforces commit-both-or-neither for this pair today.

## [1.27.8] - 2026-08-28

### Fix: the daily distribution metrics were labelled as monthly

Every strategy page showed `min`, `mean`, `median` and `max` under a "Monthly Distribution" heading,
as "Min Month" through "Max Month". **They are daily returns.** A visitor reading a strategy page was
told the worst month was -15% when that number is a single day, which understates how violent these
strategies are rather than overstating it.

**Three independent checks agree, and none of them relies on the source's documentation.** Volatility
drag means an arithmetic mean compounded over a year must exceed the geometric annualized return:
that holds for **31 of 31** featured strategies read as daily and **0 of 31** read as monthly. The
monthly reading implies 3% to 7% annual returns against stated ARRs of 90% to 277%. And the stored
`max` of 54.63% for strategies holding SOXL matches SOXL's own best single day, 54.79% on
2025-04-09, computed independently from `data/prices.json`.

The PRD contradicted itself on this, describing the fields as "single-period" in the schema section
and "Monthly distribution" in the API mapping table. Both now say daily, and the group is relabelled
**Daily Distribution** with rows **Worst Day**, **Mean Day**, **Median Day** and **Best Day**.

### Glossary: seven metric terms added, 20 to 27

Sortino Ratio, Win Rate, Skewness, Kurtosis, Tail Ratio, Herfindahl Index and Annualized Turnover.

**These were written before the sections that will use them, not after.** All seven already exist in
`data/database.json` and are queued for display on strategy pages under V1.20. Shipping a number a
visitor cannot look up adds jargon rather than understanding, so the definitions land first.

Each entry follows the existing six-section shape and each one states what the metric **cannot** tell
you, because these are the statistics most often quoted as though they settle something: win rate is
trivially gameable by taking small profits and letting losses run, skewness and kurtosis are
dominated by the few largest observations and unstable across windows, and a Herfindahl index knows
nothing about correlation, so eight leveraged funds tracking one index score as diversified while
behaving as one position.

### Roadmap: V1.20, the strategy page rebuild

Specified and approved after the owner shared a third-party Composer analysis page. Seventeen items
in four tiers, with full sequencing, recorded in `docs/PRD.md`.

**The finding that shapes it:** all 31 featured strategies join cleanly to `data/database.json` on
`symphony_id`, exposing 20 fields the strategy pages have never shown. **Nine of the seventeen items
need no new writing and no new fetching.** Three are worth naming: outlier dependence is already
computed and never displayed (the best 5% of days produced 137.5% of `zoops-holy-grail-2026`'s total
return, and above 100% means the strategy is a net loser without them); `oos_date` supports a real
out-of-sample claim (`holy-grail` unedited for 1,500 days against 165 to 214 for the 2026 zoop
editions); and turnover runs 23x to 75x annually with `total_costs` beside it.

**Joining holdings against the v1.19 K-1 database shows 12 of the 31 featured strategies currently
hold a fund that issues a Schedule K-1.** That is a tax fact about a real holding, computable today
from two files already in the repo, which Composer itself does not surface.

**One idea from the source page was tested and rejected on the measurement.** It shows real and
simulated backtests side by side, modelling leveraged ETFs backwards from their underlyings.
Comparing every featured strategy's `backtest_days` against the inception of its youngest holding
gives a gap of zero or negative in every case, so Composer already truncates to real traded history
and the distinction does not apply here. The useful inversion, stating why a window is as short as
it is, is item 9.

## [1.27.7] - 2026-08-27

### K1 Lookup: etfdb publishes the answer directly, and now that is the primary check

**The tool was inferring an answer that the source states outright.** etfdb's Tax Analysis block
carries a `Distributes K1` field, `Yes` or `No`, on every fund page. It was missed when this was
built, so every verdict came from the fund's legal structure instead. The owner spotted the field on
the live etfdb page for DRAM. It is now the primary check.

**Structure was not removed, and the reason is a fund the flag gets wrong.** etfdb answers
`Distributes K1: No` for **SOYB** and **TAGS**. Both send K-1s. Teucrium Commodity Trust's own 10-K
says the funds "are treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes" and that "the
partners report their share of a Fund's income or loss on their income tax returns", naming TAGS
explicitly, and the trust is absent from EDGAR's register of 1940-Act funds. **Had the new field
simply replaced the old logic, this release would have flipped two correct rows into a wrong answer
about someone's taxes.** It was caught because the structure reading was still there to disagree
with it.

**So a disagreement is now a visible warning, not a silent preference.** Where the flag and the
structure contradict each other the row is marked `contested`, the structure-derived verdict is the
one shown, and the result panel raises a pink-bordered warning naming both readings and telling the
reader to confirm the fund in its own prospectus or annual report before acting. The warning says
plainly that the structure winning is one precedent rather than a rule.

**Across all 186 funds, nothing is left contested.** The full re-fetch found every fund carrying a
`Distributes K1` value, and the only two that contradict their own structure are SOYB and TAGS,
both resolved by overrides that record what the 10-K says. **No verdict in the database changed**:
41 funds issue a K-1 and 145 do not, the same answers as before, now reached from the source's own
field with two independent checks behind it.

**Funds with no structure field now get answers.** DRAM (Roundhill Memory ETF) was the worked
example of the old dead end: etfdb publishes no `Structure` for it, so the tool had nothing to say.
It publishes `Distributes K1: No`, which is the whole answer. DRAM and BITO were added to
`data/k1_seed.txt` and are now in the database. The live fallback reads the new field
too, using the same precedence and the same contested rule as the build script.

**What the answer no longer does is guess.** A "no" from the flag still cannot say whether the form
is a 1099 or a 1099-B, and only the structure separates those, so a fund without one gets its
verdict and no named form rather than a plausible-looking wrong one. Capital gains rates are still
never used to infer a verdict, for the SOYB and TAGS reason.

### K1 Lookup: Export button

An **Export** button beside the table writes the current view to CSV: the active filter and sort, so
the file matches the screen rather than quietly disagreeing with it, and with the default All filter
that is the whole database. The filename records which view it was and the date the data was
refreshed.

**The file carries more columns than the table shows, on purpose.** Structure, tax form, etfdb's raw
flag, the checked date, and the contested marker. A CSV that dropped the contested column would
strip the warning off an answer while keeping the answer, which is the one export bug here that
could cost someone money.

Values beginning `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` are prefixed with an apostrophe, because spreadsheets execute
them as formulas on open. That is not hypothetical: SVIX is named "-1x Short VIX Futures ETF". The
file is written with a UTF-8 BOM and CRLF line endings so Excel reads it correctly rather than as
the local codepage.

## [1.27.6] - 2026-08-27

### K1 Lookup: a live fallback for tickers the database has never seen

Typing a ticker that is not in the shipped database used to end at "not in this database yet". It
now fetches etfdb live and answers, with the result clearly marked as unreviewed.

**This was measured, not assumed.** etfdb returns a real 200 page but sends no
`access-control-allow-origin` header, so a direct browser fetch is discarded. Every general-purpose
CORS relay tested failed for a different reason: `proxy.cors.sh` came back 403 with Cloudflare's
"Just a moment..." challenge, `codetabs` 522, `allorigins` timed out, `corsproxy.io` is paid-only,
`cors.lol` rate-limited on the first request. **`r.jina.ai` works**: a reader service that renders
the page server-side and sends CORS headers, whose extraction preserves both the `Structure` field
and the capital gains rates.

**A live answer is badged and never dressed as a database answer.** It carries a `live, unverified`
chip, states in full that it was parsed in the browser just now from a third party's rendering and
has been reviewed by nobody, and runs the same structure-versus-rates corroboration every committed
row gets. That check fired on the first real test: **GBTC** is labelled `ETF` by etfdb while
publishing `39.60%/39.60%`, which is not an ETF's rate pair, so the page reports the disagreement
and calls the result a lead rather than an answer. The verdict of No is right regardless, since GBTC
is a grantor trust and a grantor trust issues a 1099-B.

### What it refuses to do

**Some funds have no `Structure` field on etfdb at all**, and `DRAM`, the ticker that prompted this,
is one of them. The obvious patch is to read the capital gains rates instead, since DRAM publishes
`39.60%/20.00%`.

**That would be wrong, and this project already holds the counterexample.** `SOYB` and `TAGS` are
commodity pools that genuinely issue K-1s and publish exactly `39.60%/20.00%`. Ordinary-looking
rates therefore do not mean "no K-1". The page says there is no answer and explains why, rather than
guessing confidently about someone's taxes.

**A nonexistent ticker is detected properly.** The reader service answers 200 even for an upstream
404, returning etfdb's own "Page Not Found" document with a title and a URL like any other page.
Before this was handled, `ZZQQ` reported itself as a real fund named "ETF Database | Page Not Found"
with no Structure field. The service records the upstream status in a `Target URL returned error
404` line, and that is now what the check keys off.

### Two costs, accepted deliberately

Both were put to the owner before any of this was built, along with a recommendation **not** to
build it, and the owner chose to proceed. Recorded so neither reads as an oversight:

**Each fallback lookup sends the visitor's ticker to `r.jina.ai`.** A query leaves the browser in a
way nothing else on this site does. The database path, which is every hit, still sends nothing.

**The free tier is rate-limited and undocumented**, so the fallback can degrade without warning. A
rate-limit is reported as a rate-limit rather than as "not found", so a throttled lookup does not
masquerade as a missing fund.

**`FORMS` in `k1.html` now duplicates `TAX_FORMS` in `scripts/refresh_k1.py`.** Two copies of one
fact, accepted because the alternative is shipping a data file to describe five strings. A comment
in both says to change them together.

### Clicking a ticker in the table looks it up

The ticker cell is a real `?t=` link, so it can be copied, opened in a new tab and reached from the
keyboard. A plain click is intercepted and answered in place with a scroll to the result; a
modified click (new tab, new window) is left alone so the link behaves like a link.

### Column order

Now **Ticker, K1, Name**, at the owner's request. The verdict sits next to the ticker rather than
behind a long fund name.

### Verified locally

Five cases driven through the page over `python -m http.server`, against the real service: a table
ticker click loading `?t=AGG` from the database with no live badge; `GBTC` fetched live with a
verdict, a badge and its rate disagreement; `DRAM` fetched live and correctly refusing to answer;
`ZZQQ` reported as no such fund; and the column order confirmed by parsing the rendered header and
rows rather than looking at them.

## [1.27.5] - 2026-08-27

### K1 Lookup: individual stocks removed from the database

**27 company tickers are gone** (AAPL, ADI, AMAT, AMD, AMZN, ASML, AVGO, BRK/B, ENPH, INTC, KLAC,
KO, LRCX, MCHP, MRVL, MSTR, MU, NVDA, NXPI, ON, QCOM, SNPS, STM, TSLA, TSM, TXN, WMT). Removed at
the owner's request: a database about fund structure has no business holding companies.

**They came in through the seed list.** The Signal Miner price universe contains company tickers as
well as funds, and seeding from it dragged them along. A company has no fund structure to read, so
each one only ever produced a "not on etfdb" row that the page had to explain away and the table had
to exclude. `data/k1_seed.txt` now carries an explicit note saying individual stocks do not belong
in it, so a future re-seed from a ticker universe filters them out rather than rediscovering them
one 404 at a time.

**The database went 212 rows to 185.** The listed fund count is unchanged at 184, since none of
these was ever listed.

### VBF was kept, and the footnote was wrong about it

The one remaining `not_found` row is **VBF, Invesco Bond Fund**. It is not an individual stock and
so was out of scope of the removal: EDGAR shows it filing N-CSR and N-CEN, making it a **closed-end
fund**, a registered investment company. It has no etfdb page because that site covers ETFs and a
CEF is not one.

**Which made the footnote inaccurate.** It read "are not exchange-traded products", and a closed-end
fund *is* exchange-traded, it simply is not an ETF. It also would have read "A further 1 tickers
were checked". Both fixed: the sentence now says "turned out not to be an ETF" and agrees in number.

### A tradeoff worth stating

**Typing a stock ticker now gives a weaker answer than it did.** Before this change, AAPL returned
"was looked up and is not an exchange-traded product on record", which is a checked, confident
result. It now falls through to "not in this database yet, which is not the same as saying it has no
K-1", because the page can no longer know AAPL is a company rather than an unchecked fund. That is
the honest message for a ticker the database has no record of, and it is the price of not storing
companies. Recorded so it reads as a known consequence rather than a regression nobody noticed.

## [1.27.4] - 2026-08-27

### K1 Lookup: the fund table sorts

All three columns. Clicking a header sorts by it, clicking the active header flips direction, and a
new column always starts ascending rather than inheriting a direction the reader chose for a
different column.

**Ticker is both the default sort and the tiebreak on every other column.** That makes the ordering
total, so two rows never swap places between renders of the same data, which is what stops a table
from looking subtly unstable when a filter changes.

**Sorting and filtering are independent.** A sort survives a filter change and a filter survives a
sort. The chosen column and direction persist alongside them under the existing
`composer-atlas.k1.view.v1` key, which was extended rather than re-versioned: the loader validates
each field on its own, so an older stored value simply lacks the sort fields and falls back to the
defaults instead of discarding someone's saved filter.

**Headers are real buttons**, so they work from the keyboard, styled to look like the header text
they replaced. The header row is `position: sticky`, since a sortable header you have to scroll back
up to reach is a poor trade for 184 rows. The arrow is rendered only when the button carries
`aria-sort`, so the visible indicator and the state announced to a screen reader cannot drift apart.

### The verification harness had the bug, not the page

Driving the table locally, the name column reported **BROKEN** in both directions: "abrdn Physical
Silver Shares ETF" placed before "AGF U.S. Market Neutral Anti-Beta Fund", and "SPDR Gold Shares"
before "Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF" descending.

**The page was right and the check was wrong.** The page sorts names with `localeCompare`; the
harness compared with `<`, which is ASCII, and ASCII puts every uppercase letter before every
lowercase one. So it flagged the correct human ordering as an error. The fix was to the harness, not
the page, and it is recorded here because the failure looked exactly like a real bug and the
tempting move was to "fix" a correct sort until the wrong check went green.

Nine steps verified after that: default ticker ascending, ticker descending, name both ways, K1 both
ways, a reload returning on K1 descending, the sort surviving a switch to the K-1 filter, and
re-sorting by name inside that filter. All nine ordered correctly, with the arrow and `aria-sort` on
the right header each time.

## [1.27.3] - 2026-08-27

### K1 Lookup: the five funds with no name have one

Five rows in the fund table had an empty Name cell (BOXX, ETHA, SBIT, SVIX, UVIX). They are the
funds whose source page titles itself with generic marketing copy instead of the fund's name, which
v1.27.0 correctly refused to store as a name but had nothing to put in its place.

**The name was on the page the whole time, in the `<h1>`**, prefixed with the fund's own ticker
("USO United States Oil Fund LP"). The parser now reads that first and falls back to `<title>`.
This is not a second naming convention: on a sample of 12 existing rows, the `<h1>` produced a
**byte-identical** name to the one already stored in all 12, so the two sources agree wherever both
work and the `<h1>` is simply the more reliable place to read the same thing. No full re-fetch was
needed, and the remaining 179 names were left untouched rather than churned.

### The ticker prefix strip nearly inverted a fund's meaning

Stripping the leading ticker started as `ticker` followed by any of whitespace, colon, dot or
hyphen. **SVIX renders as `SVIX -1x Short VIX Futures ETF`**, so that ate the minus sign and left
"1x Short VIX Futures ETF", turning an inverse fund into a long one in the one column a reader
scans. Caught on the verification pass, before it reached the data. The strip now takes whitespace
and a colon only, and the reason is a comment in the code so nobody widens it back.

**The same backspace trap from v1.27.0 recurred**, in the same way: a `\b` written through a shell
heredoc became a literal `0x08` byte in the source, so the regex silently required an unprintable
character. Found by a check that now runs on every edit to this file rather than by noticing the
output was wrong.

All 184 listed funds now render a name; verified by parsing the rendered table and asserting no
empty Name cell, not by looking at it.

## [1.27.2] - 2026-08-27

### K1 Lookup: the table lists every fund, and remembers how you left it

Four changes to the table below the lookup box, all requested by the owner.

**It lists every fund now, not only the K-1 issuers.** Columns are **Ticker, Name, K1**, where K1
reads Yes or No. The Structure column was dropped: it explains *why* a fund gets the answer it does,
which belongs next to a single verdict where there is room to say what it means, not repeated down
184 rows.

**Three filter pills: All, K-1, No K-1.** 184 funds, 41 of them K-1 issuers.

**A collapse toggle, and it ships collapsed.** The lookup box is what the page is for; the table is
reference material underneath it, and 184 rows of it pushed everything else off the screen.
**Picking a filter while collapsed expands the table**, because a filter button that appears to do
nothing is worse than an expansion nobody asked for.

**Rows recorded as `not_found` are counted but never listed.** Those are individual stocks from the
Signal Miner ticker universe that were checked and turned out not to be exchange-traded products. A
table of funds should not contain them, so the footnote reports the 28 excluded rather than leaving
the number to silently not add up.

### The view persists between visits

Filter and collapsed state are stored under `composer-atlas.k1.view.v1`, following the
`composer-atlas.<page>.<thing>.<version>` key convention `signal-miner.html` already uses.

**This is a per-viewer convenience, not user data.** It never leaves the browser, is never sent
anywhere, and nothing but this page in that browser ever reads it, so it does not touch the site's
no-accounts, no-data-collection policy.

**Every access is wrapped, and the stored value is validated rather than trusted.** A private window
or a browser set to block site data throws on the accessor itself rather than returning empty, so an
unwrapped read is a broken page and not a missing preference. A stale or hand-edited entry cannot
put the page into a state it has no button for. Under `file://` the write throws, is swallowed, and
the page works and simply forgets between visits.

### Verified locally, by driving the page

Per the testing rule set at v1.27.1, this was proven from the working copy and nowhere else.
`localStorage` needs a real origin, so `file://` could not have verified it: a harness loaded
`k1.html` in an iframe over `python -m http.server`, clicked the page's own buttons, and read the
table back after each step.

Eight steps, all correct: first visit collapsed on All with 184 rows; K-1 clicked while collapsed
expanded to 41; Collapse and Expand round-tripped; No K-1 gave 143; **a reload came back on No K-1
and expanded**; All plus collapsed was set; **a second reload came back on All and collapsed**. Then
re-checked under `file://` to confirm the page still renders when storage refuses.

## [1.27.1] - 2026-08-27

### K1 Lookup: the address bar now follows the lookup

Pressing **Check** rewrites the URL to `?t=<TICKER>`, so what is on screen is always what is in the
address bar. Reported by the owner from a real case: the URL still read `?t=UVXY` while the panel
showed BIL, which made the link uncopyable and a reload show something other than the answer on
screen.

**`replaceState`, not `pushState`, on purpose.** Pushing would make the Back button walk through
every ticker someone tried before leaving the page, which is not what Back means to a person using a
lookup box. Replacing keeps the URL copyable and keeps Back as "leave".

**The URL is set before the result branches**, so all three outcomes are linkable, not just a found
row. A ticker that is unknown to the database, or one recorded as not an exchange-traded product,
produces a link that reproduces that same message. **Clear** strips the parameter rather than
leaving a stale one behind.

**Wrapped in a try/catch because `file://` refuses it.** `replaceState` throws a `SecurityError`
there, and this page is expected to work from a local file. A failed URL update must not stop the
lookup, so the failure is swallowed.

### Testing policy: local first, and stop there

**Owner instruction, and now the documented rule:** verify changes by running them from the working
copy, and **do not troubleshoot Cloudflare Pages or GitHub Pages when the local run is correct**. A
page that works locally and is missing from a host is a deployment matter, not a defect in the
change. Written up in `docs/PRD.md` Section 23 with two new rows in the verification table.

**`file://` alone cannot verify everything, and this release is the example.** It is not an origin,
so `replaceState`, `fetch()` of a local path and `localStorage` throw or no-op there. The URL syncing
above is *correct* under `file://` precisely because its failure is caught, which means `file://`
proves only that its absence breaks nothing. `python -m http.server 8731 --bind 127.0.0.1` from the
repository root is the answer, and needs no configuration because the site has no build step.

**Verified by driving the page rather than reading its DOM.** A throwaway harness loaded `k1.html`
in an iframe over `127.0.0.1`, clicked its own buttons, and read the URL back after each: the
`?t=UVXY` deep link resolved to Yes; a lowercase `bil` normalised to `?t=BIL`; `USO` gave `?t=USO`;
an unknown `ZZZZ` and a non-ETP `AAPL` both linked correctly with the panel hidden; **Clear** emptied
the query string. Then re-checked under `file://` to confirm the guard leaves the lookup working.

## [1.27.0] - 2026-08-27

### New tool: K1 Lookup (`/k1`)

Type a ticker, find out whether holding it sends you a **Schedule K-1** instead of a 1099. Requested
by the owner, who had been answering the question by hand from an 88-row spreadsheet.

**Why it earns a page.** A K-1 arrives late, often after the April filing deadline, complicates a
return, and can hand a holder taxable income in a year they sold nothing. Composer symphonies route
into leveraged and inverse volatility products constantly, and those are exactly the funds that do
this. Nothing on the site told anyone that before today.

### The signal is legal structure, not a published K-1 flag

**No source publishes the flag.** What is published is the fund's legal structure, and structure
fixes the tax form: Commodity Pool means a K-1, ETF and UIT mean a 1099, ETN means a 1099-B, Grantor
Trust means a 1099-B at the collectibles rate. Nothing is inferred from a ticker symbol or a fund's
name.

**A second, independent field corroborates every row**, which is why both are stored. Max short and
long-term capital gains rates fall out of the structure rather than being copied from it, so they are
a genuine cross-check: `27.84% / 27.84%` is the Section 1256 60/40 blend and only a commodity pool
shows it; `39.60% / 28.00%` is the collectibles rate and means a grantor trust. Where the two
readings contradict each other the row carries `agrees: false` and **the page says so rather than
picking a winner**. That mechanism was not decorative. It caught a real error on its first run.

### The lookup is local, and it had to be

The upstream source sits behind Cloudflare bot mitigation and sends no `access-control-allow-origin`
header, so neither a browser nor a public CORS relay can read it from the page. A live per-visitor
lookup is not available at any price. `scripts/refresh_k1.py` therefore fetches on a maintainer's
machine and the site ships the answers, which is also why the page is instant and works offline.

**212 tickers: 41 issue a K-1, 143 do not, 28 are not exchange-traded products** (individual stocks
in the Signal Miner universe, recorded rather than skipped so a re-run does not keep asking). The
seed list is the owner's 88, the site's own ticker universes, and a candidate list of likely
issuers. `data/k1_seed.txt` says what it is in its header, and the wording is load-bearing: **a
ticker in that file is a request to check it, not a claim about it.**

### Verified against sources the script never touches

The owner asked for 10 K-1 tickers and 10 non-K-1 tickers to be pulled at random and checked
independently. That was done against **SEC EDGAR**, and the "no" side needed a better test than the
"yes" side did.

**For the K-1 side, filing type is decisive:** all ten (UUP, DBC, VIXM, EUO, UGL, AGQ, USO, UDN,
BOIL, UGA) file a **10-K** and no N-CSR, which no 1940-Act fund does, under entity names that say the
same thing (`United States Oil Fund, LP`, `ProShares Trust II`). Ten of ten agreed.

**For the non-K-1 side, absence from a file proves nothing**, so the first attempt was thrown out.
The replacement is a positive test: EDGAR publishes `company_tickers_mf.json`, which lists **only**
funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, because series and class identifiers are a
1940-Act construct. Presence there is proof of 1099 treatment rather than an argument for it. All ten
(XHB, QID, IYK, PDBC, IOO, BOXX, MLPA, DBMF, BTAL, UPW) appear with a series and class ID. **Ten of
ten agreed, and the control held**: none of the ten K-1 tickers appears in that file, which is what
makes the test mean anything.

### One real error, found and corrected

The sample passed 20 for 20, so the same test was then swept across the **whole** database rather
than stopping there. Of the 41 tickers called commodity pools, exactly one turned out to be a
registered 1940-Act fund: **CMDY** (iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF). The source
labelled it a Commodity Pool, which would mean a K-1. EDGAR gives it series `S000061337` and class
`C000198581`, so it is a registered investment company and issues a 1099, and the capital gains rates
on the source's own page (39.60%/20.00%) agreed with EDGAR rather than with its structure label. The
corroboration check had already flagged the row before EDGAR was consulted.

**The correction lives in an `OVERRIDES` table in the script, not in `data/k1.json`,** because a
hand-edited row is silently undone by the next refresh. Each entry carries the reasoning that earned
it and **the page prints that reasoning** rather than quietly showing a different answer.

Five further rows carry a note without a changed verdict (SOYB, TAGS, IBIT, ETHA, OUNZ). Their two
source fields contradict each other but the verdict was confirmed independently, and printing "treat
this answer as unconfirmed" over an answer that has in fact been confirmed would be the wrong kind
of caution. The run summary now separates rows already verified from rows that still need a look, so
the second list does not get buried under a first list that never shrinks.

### Three outcomes, deliberately distinguished

A ticker in the database renders its verdict, structure, tax form, both rates, and a link to verify
by hand. A ticker recorded as `not_found` says it is not an exchange-traded product on record. A
ticker the database has never seen says exactly that: **"not in this database yet, which is not the
same as saying it has no K-1."** The third case is the one worth getting right. Silently answering
"No" for an unknown ticker would be a wrong answer about someone's taxes wearing a confident face.

### Two parsing bugs fixed before shipping

**A minority of fund pages title themselves with generic marketing copy** rather than the fund's
name, so five rows had stored `"BOXX ETF Guide | Stock Quote, Holdings, Fact Sheet and More"` where a
name belongs, and the page printed it. Now cut back to nothing, and the page shows the ticker alone.

**The first fix did not work, and the reason is worth recording.** The cleanup regex was written
through a shell heredoc where `\b` became a literal backspace byte, so the pattern silently required
an unprintable character that no page contains. It parsed, ran, and did nothing. Found by dumping the
line through `cat -A`.

### Removed

`data/K1 Lookup Example.xlsx`, the owner's manual spreadsheet, deleted at their request now that the
database supersedes it. All 88 of its tickers were confirmed present in `data/k1.json` first, and the
database agrees with the sheet's verdict on every one of them.

### Roadmap

**V1.19** added to `docs/PRD.md` Section 14 with a Milestones row. Its one open item is the owner's
request to **display whether a fund is an ETN**, which is nearly free because `structure` already
carries the value. It is worth a real callout rather than a quiet field: an ETN is not a fund but
senior unsecured debt of the issuing bank, so the holder carries that bank's credit risk with no
basket of assets behind the shares. That is a different risk from the tax question the page answers
today, and someone checking one is very likely to want the other.

**Files changed:** `k1.html` (new), `scripts/refresh_k1.py` (new), `data/k1.json` (new),

## [1.26.2] - 2026-08-25

### Roadmap: V1.18, leaderboard out-of-sample weighting

Documentation only. Nothing in the scoring model changed.

The owner posted the live Leaderboard publicly and a community member (Spacer) came back with a
specific, checkable observation: **a symphony at the top of the Leaderboard has underperformed SPY
across its six months of out-of-sample time.** The owner agreed the OOS weight is "way too low"
against backtest length, said the factor set was "kinda just thrown in there", and wants the model
**simpler**. Logged as `docs/PRD.md` Section 14, **V1.18**, with a Milestones row.

**The complaint is arithmetically fair.** V1.17 gives `backtest_days` **97 points** and OOS days
**25**, so backtest length outweighs out-of-sample length roughly four to one.

### The finding that reframes the request

**The model has no out-of-sample performance metric at all, only out-of-sample duration**, and that
matters more than the weighting. `oos_date` is the symphony's last logic edit, taken from the
Composer API's `last_semantic_update_at`; the scored quantity is a day count off that date. All 29
fields in `database_summary.json` were checked: nothing measures performance since `oos_date`, and
there is **no benchmark of any kind in the dataset**. SPY appears nowhere.

So **raising the OOS-days weight would not fix the case that prompted this and would probably make
it worse.** The symphony named has six months of untouched history, which is a respectable OOS
*duration*; scoring duration harder rewards it further. "It underperformed SPY out of sample" is
about OOS *return against a benchmark*, which the model cannot currently express. Reweighting is the
wrong lever for the stated problem. It is a real issue, but a different one.

### A cheap first step, and what it still will not do

**Some trailing-return windows are already fully out-of-sample and nothing exploits that.** Where OOS
duration is at least 365 days, `trailing_one_year_return` covers only days after the last logic edit,
so it already *is* a true out-of-sample return; likewise `trailing_three_month_return` past 90 days.
Scoring the longest trailing window that fits inside the OOS period needs **no new fields, no new API
calls, and no backtesting**, and it treats a symphony with no qualifying window as a hard zero,
exactly as the model already treats missing data.

**Measured against the live pool**, over the 6,471 eligible entries: **79.2% have at least 365 days
of OOS**, so `trailing_one_year_return` is already a genuine out-of-sample return for four rows in
five, and some window qualifies for 99.97% of the pool. That distribution also calibrates the floor
proposal (a one-year floor cuts about 21% of the pool) and warns about the weighting one: since 79%
already clear a year, **OOS duration barely separates the pool at the top**, so weighting it harder
mostly reshuffles rows that already look fine on it.

It still does not give the benchmark comparison, which needs SPY's trailing returns stored and
refreshed on the same weekly cadence. Cheap, but a real scope addition and a real decision.

### Spacer's two proposals, costed

**A minimum OOS duration before boosting** fits the existing machinery: it is an eligibility rule,
not a weighting change, and the model already has an eligibility gate. A floor like "no S+ or S
without N days of OOS" needs no change to the point table at all.

**Dynamic scaling of the OOS weight by OOS length conflicts with a load-bearing property.** Every
metric has a fixed cap and the caps sum to exactly 1,000, which is what makes two rows comparable and
lets missing data score zero without shrinking the denominator. A per-row weight means a per-row
denominator. Two ways out are recorded with their costs: renormalise each row back to 1,000 (rows
comparable again, but a row's score depends on its own weighting, which is hard to explain in the
breakdown modal), or keep the cap fixed and vary the *input*, scoring a duration-adjusted OOS return
instead. The second is smaller and preserves the fixed denominator, so it is flagged as the one to
evaluate first.

### Two strands, deliberately not conflated

The simplification the owner wants is a separate axis from OOS weighting, and the roadmap says so:
doing both in one pass makes it impossible to attribute a rank change to either. V1.17 already did
this exercise once and identified the Asymmetry/Shape and Concentration/Fragility metrics (six
metrics, 170 points) as least mission-aligned and most redundant with Max Drawdown and Standard
Deviation, so the obvious cut is documented with reasons already and does not need re-deriving.

Five open questions are recorded rather than answered, since all five are the owner's call. The
validation route is not among them: V1.17's precedent of scoring candidate models against the live
pool in a throwaway script before touching the site is carried forward, with the publicly named
symphony as one of the test cases.

## [1.26.1] - 2026-08-25

### The sitemap regenerates itself now

`scripts/build_sitemap.py` has existed since v1.25.1 and **nothing ran it**. Strategy `lastmod`
values come from each entry's `last_updated`, which `update_metrics.py` rewrites, so every weekly
metrics refresh staledated all 31 strategy entries and only a hand run put them right. That was
logged during the v1.25.1 work and left open until now.

`.github/workflows/update-metrics.yml` now runs the script straight after `update_metrics.py` and
commits `sitemap.xml` with the strategy data. That workflow is the only one that writes
`data/strategies.json`, so it is the only one that can cause the staleness. Page `lastmod` values
self-heal on the same daily run, so forgetting to regenerate after adding a page now costs one day
of a slightly stale date rather than lasting indefinitely.

### fetch-depth: 0, and a prediction that was wrong

**The naive wiring would have made the file worse, not better.** `build_sitemap.py` reads each
page's `lastmod` from `git log -1 --format=%cs -- <path>`, and `actions/checkout` clones shallow by
default.

The first version of this note predicted that a shallow clone returns an empty result, that the
script would omit `lastmod` as designed, and that the file would simply churn. **That was wrong, and
it was only caught by making a real `--depth 1` clone and running the command.** On a shallow clone
the single fetched commit is grafted as the root, so git believes every file in the tree was last
modified in it. The command succeeds and returns **today's date, for every page, every day**.
Measured: all ten pages came back `2026-08-25` against true dates from `2026-06-22` to `2026-08-24`.

That is the worse failure, not the harmless one. The script omits `lastmod` when it cannot know the
date, on the principle that an absent value beats a wrong one, and a shallow checkout defeats that
protection by handing it a date that is confidently wrong rather than missing. Every page would
claim to have changed today, forever, which is exactly how a crawler learns to ignore `lastmod`.

The job therefore checks out with `fetch-depth: 0`. That is a full clone of a 122MB history on a
daily job, weighed and accepted against publishing a daily lie. Both the workflow comment and
`docs/PRD.md` Section 11 record the real behaviour and the corrected prediction, because the
reasoning matters more than the flag.

### A deploy-time gate was considered and declined

A fourth gate could regenerate the sitemap in memory and fail the deploy when the committed file
differs, catching "added a page and forgot" immediately. Not built: it needs `fetch-depth: 0` on
`deploy.yml` as well, slowing every deploy, and the failure it prevents costs one day of a stale
`lastmod` on one page. The three existing gates each guard something silent **and** damaging. This
one is neither. Recorded in Section 11 so the decision is not re-litigated from scratch.

### Fixed: nodes.html had no lastmod in the live sitemap

`sitemap.xml` was regenerated during v1.26.0 while `nodes.html` was still untracked, so `git log`
could not date it and the entry shipped without a `lastmod`. Regenerated after the commit landed.
This is the exact inaccuracy Section 11 already warned about, which is a fair argument that the
automation above should have come first.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added: Nodes, a symphony node counter

**Paste a Composer symphony URL and get its node count.** Composer prices its tiers by node count
($40/month against $10/month) and **does not show that number anywhere in the platform**. Composer
support confirmed on 2026-08-17 that the feature is planned but not built, and gave the definition
in the meantime. `nodes.html` implements that definition against the real `/score` tree, and shows
the breakdown rather than only the total, so the number can be checked rather than trusted.

**Named `nodes`, not `node-calculator`.** One word, matching `converter`, `glossary`, `database`,
`strategies`. "Calculator" also oversells it: nothing is calculated, a tree is counted.

### How a node is counted

Composer's five categories, mapped onto the `step` values the API actually returns:

| Composer's category | `step` |
|---|---|
| Each asset (stock or ETF) | `asset` |
| Each IF statement | `if` |
| Each FILTER block | `filter` |
| Each GROUP container | `group` |
| Each weighting method block | any `wt-*` |

**Two steps are deliberately not counted, and the page says so on screen rather than hiding it.**
`root` is the symphony itself. `if-child` is the THEN/ELSE branch container Composer generates
underneath every IF, and it is the one judgement call in the whole tool: across 15 real symphonies
sampled while building this, it appeared **exactly twice per `if`, without exception** (5,162
against 2,581), so it is generated structure rather than anything a user placed. Counting it would
treble every conditional.

**Weighting blocks are matched on the `wt-` prefix rather than against a fixed list**, so a
weighting method this repo has not seen still lands in the right row. Anything genuinely
unrecognised is counted as one node each **and flagged in the breakdown**, so a Composer schema
change surfaces as a visible warning instead of silently skewing the total.

**The count runs far higher than people expect**, because an asset counts every time it appears. A
filter over six tickers is six asset nodes plus the filter, and reusing that set inside several IF
branches counts it again each time. Verified totals: a single-asset symphony is **2**, zoop's 2026
Frontrunner is **21** (7 assets, 6 IF, 1 group, 7 weighting), and one real community symphony,
"Portfolio Consolidation 1", is **5,935**, of which 4,470 are assets. Every total was checked
against an independent count over the same JSON.

### The CORS problem, and what the page does about it

**Composer's `/score` endpoint returns HTTP 200 with no `access-control-allow-origin` header**, so a
browser can reach it but cannot read the response. There is no header or origin that lifts this. The
page therefore tries four sources in order: **direct first**, so it starts working on its own the
day Composer adds the header, then the same three public relays the ETF Cloner already uses
(`proxy.cors.sh`, allorigins, codetabs), and finally a link to the raw JSON plus a paste box.

**Worth recording honestly: two of those three relays were returning 502/522 during this build**, so
the URL path currently rests on `proxy.cors.sh` alone. The paste fallback is what makes that
survivable rather than fatal. The durable fix would be a Cloudflare Pages Function proxying the
endpoint, which is not being done here because it adds a server component to a site that
deliberately has none and would not work on the GitHub Pages mirror.

A relay that reaches Composer passes its status through, so **a 404 is reported as "no such
symphony"** rather than as a relay failure. The two have completely different fixes and an error
message that confuses them sends people to debug the wrong thing.

### Wiring and docs

Nodes is in the nav **Tools** dropdown, the footer sitemap, and the homepage Explore grid (now eight
cards, not seven). `sitemap.xml` regenerated: **41 URLs**, 10 indexable pages plus the 31 curated
strategy slugs. The node definition and the step mapping are documented in `docs/PRD.md` Section 13
under the Logic Tree Endpoint, next to the CORS note, since that is reference knowledge about
Composer's API rather than about this page. `check_html_js.py` passes on all 14 HTML files, and `scripts/check_live.py` now covers the new
page too (9 checked, 0 failed), so a future deploy that breaks it is caught rather than assumed.

**Files changed:** `nodes.html` (added), `js/app.js`, `index.html`, `sitemap.xml`,
`scripts/check_live.py`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.25.5] - 2026-08-24

### Docs: outside input on plateau scoring logged against roadmap item A

A friend of the owner, working from an independent conversation with Claude, proposed a plateau check
of plus or minus 3 to 5 RSI points, a window tolerance of plus or minus 15% to 20% of the window
length, and two passes: one to find single values that show promise, then a second running the
plateau-neighbourhood check on them. Recorded in `docs/PRD.md` Section 14 under item C1, the
neighbourhood grid, as the first outside read on that design. **No roadmap item changed status and
nothing was built**; item A remains designed-but-unbuilt and PRD risk 6 remains the largest open
product risk on the site.

**Two of the three points turned out to be corroboration rather than novelty**, which is worth more
than either would be alone. The window tolerance is the same figure this spec already carries: C1
sweeps "10 days plus or minus 2", which is plus or minus 20%, reached independently. The two-pass
structure is the architecture C1 already requires, that the rating runs on demand for displayed or
selected rows and never as a third pass over the whole search. A terminology warning went in beside
it, since the Miner already uses "Pass 1" and "Pass 2" to mean single signals and pair rows, and
reading the proposed second pass as the existing Pass 2 would describe a plan to rate every pair row
in a full search, the one thing the design rules out.

**The level range is the one genuinely new proposal, and it is deliberately not adopted as a fixed
number.** C1's grid is plus or minus 1 RSI point at 0.25 steps, a fine local refinement probing
off-lattice values the Miner cannot report; plus or minus 3 to 5 points is the separate plateau-width
statistic from item A, the one quoted as "holds from 20 to 28". Both scales were already specced, and
the standing decision holds: build the scoring first, see what widths real results produce, and let
the data choose rather than guessing. If real plateaus cluster at 3 to 5 points, it will say so with
evidence behind it.

**The proposal came with an intent to run it overnight, and that is recorded as wrong on the
measurements already in the section.** At the proposed width the grid is about 41 level cells by 5
window cells, 205 per row against C1's 45. At the measured 90 microseconds per backtest that is
roughly 18 ms per row, under 2 seconds for a 100-row leaderboard. Widening the range as proposed
costs nothing anyone would notice. Overnight only becomes real if the rating is applied to every row
of a full run, which the design rules out.

## [1.25.4] - 2026-08-24

### Every approved symphony is archived in storage.csv, and it is now enforced

**The containment rule, stated: `database.json` is a subset of `storage.csv`, never the other way
round.** The archive holds every symphony URL ever seen, alive or dead, and never loses one. The
database holds only the symphonies approved for the site. So an approved symphony must always have
an archived URL, while the archive holding symphonies the database does not is the design working.

**Five approved symphonies had no archived URL, and now do:** `0jPwZ5Lm2Y3xH24oEijB` (Triple
Accelerator), `zY4jRnXoFC9e1Pt97YDS`, `P7RLUTtWmTjkJBaNBQT9`, `tlDwKY3NRXjYU61jCt0g` (The Gold Miner
(Original)) and `jjIQMCxLK5P98Zpczktk`. **Four of the five are the same symphonies that were missing
from `database_summary.json` until v1.25.1**, which is one cause showing up twice: the hand-run
addition routes write `database.json` and stop, updating neither the archive before it nor the
derived summary after it.

It failed safe rather than losing anything, since `purge_flagged_entries.py` aborts rather than drop
a row whose URL it cannot find in the archive, so those five could not have been purged at all. But
an incomplete archive is the one thing `storage.csv` exists not to be.

### Added: scripts/sync_database_to_storage.py

The mirror of `sync_storage_to_database.py`, and the safe one of the pair. **The two are not
symmetrical in risk:** promotion moves archived URLs into the approved database, which is an approval
decision and can resurrect symphonies purged as dead. This one only widens the archive, which is what
the archive is for.

Idempotent, and **keyed on `symphony_id` rather than the URL string**, which matters more here than
anywhere else: Composer serves the same symphony under more than one path, and archiving a redundant
second URL in a file that never deletes anything would be permanent. New rows are appended at the
end, the way the file has grown since it was seeded, keeping the diff to the five lines added.

### Added: a fifth check on the database gate

`scripts/check_database_keys.py` now also asserts that every `database.json` symphony has its URL in
`storage.csv`. Run against the pre-fix data it named all five offenders and exited non-zero.

**It checks one direction on purpose.** The reverse gap, `storage.csv` holding symphonies
`database.json` does not, is deliberate and currently stands at 1,045 symphonies, most of them from
the v1.11.14 purge of permanently-dead entries. Gating that direction would fail every deploy for
doing exactly what the design asks.

The hand-addition workflow in `docs/PRD.md` Section 23 now names all four steps in order: write the
row, archive the URL, regenerate the summary, run the gate. Skipping either middle step is silent,
and both have already happened. A matching never-do row was added. Closes PRD open question 25.

**Files changed:** `scripts/sync_database_to_storage.py` (added), `scripts/check_database_keys.py`,
`data/storage.csv`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.25.3] - 2026-08-24

### Docs: storage.csv is larger than database.json on purpose, and v1.25.2 said otherwise

**Correction, on owner instruction.** The v1.25.2 entry below logged the size gap between
`data/storage.csv` and `data/database.json` as "open question 23", asking whether the 1,045
unpromoted URLs should be brought into the database. **That framing was wrong, and the question
should never have been written.** The two files hold different things by design:

| | `data/storage.csv` | `data/database.json` |
|---|---|---|
| **What it holds** | **Every symphony URL ever seen**, kept long term whether the symphony is alive, dead, private, deleted, noise or a duplicate | **Only the symphonies confirmed and approved for the site** |
| **Admission** | Nothing is excluded. A URL is added on sight | Deliberate, and reversible |
| **Removal** | **Never** | Routine: purged, flagged, de-duplicated, re-scoped |
| **Count today** | 7,709 rows, 7,708 distinct symphonies | 6,668 entries, 6,668 distinct symphonies |

The gap is the design working. Its largest single contributor is the v1.11.14 purge, which removed
1,004 permanently-dead entries from `database.json` while keeping every one of their URLs in
`storage.csv` forever, exactly as intended.

**The v1.25.2 audit also missed that the project had already documented this**, in the AddSymphony
workflow in `docs/PRD.md` Section 11, since 2026-07-15, including a warning about the specific
accident the audit then repeated. The relationship is now stated as a table in Section 12 under
"storage.csv Is Larger Than database.json, On Purpose", pointed at from Section 6's count block and
from the directory tree, so it is findable from wherever a reader meets the numbers. Per the practice
of not rewriting history, the v1.25.2 entry stands as written and this is the correction.

### Docs: the never-run rule now states the real reason

Section 23's never-do row on `sync_storage_to_database.py` said the risk was growing the dataset by
15%. **The actual risk is worse and more specific: a blind run resurrects dead symphonies into the
approved database.** The script cannot distinguish "a URL nobody has processed yet" from "a URL
deliberately purged as dead", so it brings back everything the v1.11.14 purge removed. This has now
happened twice, on 2026-07-15 (1,055 rows) and 2026-08-24 (1,045 rows), both reverted and neither
committed. Section 12's promotion guidance was corrected in the same pass: it used to end "run this
whenever `storage.csv` has grown since the last sync", which is the advice that caused both
incidents. **Promotion is an approval decision, not a sync.**

### Docs: two open questions logged, one of them a real gap in the archive

Question 23 is withdrawn. Two replace it.

**Question 24: `sync_storage_to_database.py` has no dry-run mode.** It writes on every invocation, so
there is no way to ask what it would promote without promoting it. A `--dry-run` flag would have
prevented both incidents above, though it makes the wrong operation safer rather than making it
right.

**Question 25: five entries are in `database.json` but not in `storage.csv`.** That inverts the
"never lose a URL once seen" rule in the direction nothing checks: `0jPwZ5Lm2Y3xH24oEijB` (Triple
Accelerator), `zY4jRnXoFC9e1Pt97YDS`, `P7RLUTtWmTjkJBaNBQT9`, `tlDwKY3NRXjYU61jCt0g` (The Gold Miner
(Original)) and `jjIQMCxLK5P98Zpczktk`. **Four of the five are the same symphonies that were missing
from `database_summary.json` until v1.25.1**, which points at a single cause: the hand-run addition
routes write `database.json` and stop, updating neither the durable archive before it nor the derived
summary after it. It fails safe today, since `purge_flagged_entries.py` aborts rather than remove a
row whose URL is absent from `storage.csv`, so these five cannot be purged at all. But an incomplete
archive is the one thing `storage.csv` exists not to be. Left for the owner rather than fixed here,
because `storage.csv` is append-only and nothing is ever deleted from it, so adding a row is not
reversible.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.25.2] - 2026-08-24

### symphony_id is the database's primary key, and it is now enforced

**Owner ruling: `data/database.json` is always deduplicated on its primary key.** That key is
`symphony_id`. No two entries may share one, and every entry must have one. Stated in `docs/PRD.md`
Section 12 as "The Primary Key Invariant" and gated on every deploy, rather than left as an
assumption three separate scripts each made in their own way.

**One duplicate was removed.** Two entries carried `symphony_id` `chkrQ6BnXCw31n7OIEaK`, both named
"Hedged Sector Rotator " with the same trailing space, both unflagged, identical on all 37 fields
except that one `symphony_url` ended `/details` and the other `/factsheet`. Verified field by field
before deleting, so nothing was lost by choosing either; the `/details` row was kept because it is
the form the other 6,667 rows use. The database now holds **6,668 entries with 6,668 distinct ids**.
`database.js` and both summary twins were regenerated in the same pass.

**The root cause was a claim in the schema itself.** The Full Database schema described
`symphony_url` as "always present, the true unique key", and `scripts/sync_storage_to_database.py`
was built on that: it compared URL strings to decide whether a symphony was already known. Composer
serves the same symphony under more than one path, so a second URL for a known symphony read as a new
symphony and was appended as a new row. That script now keys on `symphony_id`, falling back to the
URL only when no id can be parsed, and also deduplicates within a single run so `storage.csv` listing
one symphony twice adds it once. The schema's original wording is kept with the correction beside it,
because it is the reasoning the pipeline was built on and deleting it would hide why the bug existed.
**`storage.csv` needs no editing:** it still contains the `/factsheet` URL, and a run of the fixed
script correctly skipped it.

### Added: a third deploy gate, scripts/check_database_keys.py

Read-only, exits non-zero, and runs in `deploy.yml` beside `check_html_js.py` and
`check_composer_ladder.py`. Four checks, each on a failure that is otherwise silent:

1. **Every entry has a non-empty `symphony_id`.** A null key makes every downstream join wrong with
   nothing to say so.
2. **`symphony_id` values are unique.** A duplicate shows the same symphony twice in every list view
   and counts it twice in every total.
3. **The id embedded in `symphony_url` matches the `symphony_id` field.** The two are written by
   different code paths at different times and can disagree.
4. **`database_summary.json` holds the same ids in the same order as `database.json`.** The site
   reads the summary, so a summary that falls behind makes real symphonies invisible. This is the
   failure that hid four of them until v1.25.1, and it compares ids rather than only counts, so a
   same-size divergence is caught too.

**Why a gate and not just the script fix.** Fixing `sync_storage_to_database.py` closes the path that
caused this instance, not the class. `database.json` is also written by hand, through the
`AddSymphony.csv` route and the ad-hoc cluster corrections, and no care taken inside a script
prevents that. The gate checks the artifact, so it holds regardless of what produced it. The cost was
weighed and accepted: a third gate to maintain, parsing an 18.7MB file on every deploy, about a
second. Closes PRD open questions 21 and 22.

### Docs: the Cloudflare 403, and two findings logged

**`scripts/check_live.py` sends a `User-Agent` header for a reason that was never written down.**
Cloudflare returns **HTTP 403 to Python's default `urllib` User-Agent on every URL**, including
`robots.txt`, as ordinary bot protection. From a script it looks exactly like an outage; from a
browser the site looks fine. A blanket 403, on `robots.txt` as much as on a page, is the signature of
the bot filter rather than a broken deploy, and a genuinely missing file returns 404 once the header
is set, which is how the sitemap's absence was told apart from the site being down during the v1.25.1
verification. Now in Section 11's troubleshooting list along with two neighbours: a newly pushed file
takes roughly 30 seconds to appear on Cloudflare Pages, and a `check_live.py` byte mismatch on an
untouched file is almost always CRLF working copies against LF in the repository.

**Two findings logged rather than acted on.** `data/storage.csv` holds **7,709 URLs against the
database's 6,668**, a backlog of 1,045 never promoted. That is not a defect, since `storage.csv` is
deliberately a superset, but whether the backlog should be refreshed into the database is a product
decision and is now open question 23. It was found by running `sync_storage_to_database.py` to check
the dedupe fix, which promoted all 1,045 in one pass; **the run was reverted**, and the second finding
is the reason it could happen: **that script has no dry-run flag and writes on every invocation.**
Both the warning and the missing flag are recorded, the former in Section 23's never-do table.

**Files changed:** `scripts/check_database_keys.py` (added), `scripts/sync_storage_to_database.py`,
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`,
`data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.25.1] - 2026-08-24

### sitemap.xml now exists, and it is generated rather than written by hand

`robots.txt` has advertised `https://composeratlas.com/sitemap.xml` since the file was created, and
that URL returned 404 on both hosts the entire time. Every crawler that read `robots.txt` was
followed a pointer to nothing. The line was the right intention, so the fix was to produce the file
rather than delete the line.

`scripts/build_sitemap.py` writes it, and **`sitemap.xml` is generated output that must never be
hand-edited.** 40 URLs: the 9 indexable top-level pages, plus one per curated strategy as
`strategies.html?slug=<slug>`, 31 of them.

**Nothing in it is hardcoded, which is the point.** Pages are discovered by globbing the repository
root, so a new page joins the sitemap without anyone remembering this script exists. Three
exclusions, each for a stated reason: `404.html` is an error document rather than a destination, the
same principle that keeps it out of the footer sitemap; `_*.html` are local mockups and harness pages
already gitignored and listed in `.assetsignore`; and any page carrying a `noindex` robots meta,
which today is only `signal-lab.html`, the redirect stub superseded by `signal-miner.html`. Strategy
URLs come from `data/strategies.json`, so the curated set cannot drift out of sync either.

**The strategy slugs are included on purpose and the database rows are excluded on purpose.**
`strategies.html` sets a per-slug `<title>` and meta description at render time, so each slug is a
genuinely distinct document to a crawler that runs JS. The 6,669 community database rows get no such
treatment: enumerating thin, near-identical query-string URLs at that volume is how a sitemap gets
ignored.

**`lastmod` is emitted only where it can be known.** Strategy URLs use each entry's own
`last_updated`; page URLs use the file's last commit date from `git log`, and the element is omitted
entirely if git is unavailable or the file is untracked. An absent `lastmod` is fine; a wrong one is
worse than none. `changefreq` and `priority` are deliberately not emitted at all, since Google has
stated it ignores both and any value chosen for them is a guess.

Only the canonical host gets a sitemap. The GitHub Pages mirror is not given one, because it serves
the same content and should not compete with `composeratlas.com` for it.

### Fixed: four symphonies were in the database but invisible on the site

`data/database_summary.json` held 6,665 rows against `data/database.json`'s 6,669. The site reads the
summary, not the full file, so four symphonies existed in the data and could not be seen anywhere on
`database.html`: "Pals Minor Spell of Summon Money (Core Logic)", "PP MAX TEC", "The Gold Miner
(Original)" and "Extended Backtest Simplified Copy of [ChristMas] Test #1". All four are unflagged
and valid, so nothing had filtered them out; the export had simply not been re-run. Regenerated, and
verified: 6,669 rows in the same order as `database.json`, and the `.js` twin parses to a structure
identical to the JSON.

**Why it drifted is the part worth keeping.** The weekly `refresh-full-database.yml` job does
regenerate the summary, so the automated path was never at fault, and none of the four arrived
through it. Two came in through the `AddSymphony.csv` route at v1.15.5, one was a lone direct
addition, and one was the curated addition of "The Gold Miner (Original)". Each of those is a
hand-run workflow that appends to `database.json` and regenerates `database.js` but not the summary,
and each of their patch notes shows the omission in its own "Files changed" list. Nothing compares
the two files, so the failure is silent by construction. Whether that should be a deploy gate is
recorded as open question 21 in `docs/PRD.md` rather than decided here, because this is a fix
release.

### Fixed: export_summary.py could silently drop a column

`scripts/export_summary.py` derived its field list from `entries[0].keys()` alone. Every entry
carries an identical key set today, so the output was correct, but the day a field is added to later
entries without backfilling the first, that column would vanish from the summary with no error
anywhere, and the site reads the summary. It now takes the union of every entry's keys in first-seen
order. Verified to produce a byte-identical field list to the old form against the current dataset:
29 fields, same order, so nothing about the shipped layout changed.

### Docs: two audit findings closed, two new open questions logged

PRD discrepancies 3 and 5 moved from Open to Resolved, keeping their numbers so existing references
still resolve, which is why that table is no longer in numeric order. Risks 3 and 5 marked CLOSED
with their resolutions. Section 11 gained a "Regenerating the Sitemap" runbook, Section 10's tree and
Section 22's route table gained `sitemap.xml`, and Section 6's staleness note records the fix rather
than the problem.

Two new open questions were logged rather than acted on. **Question 21:** nothing enforces that the
summary matches the full database, and closing risk 5 fixed the instance, not the class.
**Question 22:** `data/database.json` contains one exact duplicate, two rows sharing `symphony_id`
`chkrQ6BnXCw31n7OIEaK`, both named "Hedged Sector Rotator " with the same trailing space and
identical metrics, so 6,669 rows resolve to 6,668 distinct ids. Found during this fix and left alone,
because deleting a row from the canonical dataset is a data decision rather than a sync fix. Impact
is cosmetic today: the row appears twice in list views and is counted twice in every total.

**Files changed:** `scripts/build_sitemap.py` (added), `sitemap.xml` (added),
`scripts/export_summary.py`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `docs/PRD.md`,
`docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.25.0] - 2026-08-24

### Full documentation audit: all four documents rewritten against the code

Every document in the project was read start to finish, checked claim by claim against the codebase
and against both live hosts, and then updated. The first three steps were strictly read-only; nothing
was written until the comparison was finished. No document was skipped. The process itself is now
recorded in `docs/PRD.md` Section 18 so the next audit does not have to be reinvented.

**`README.md` was rewritten for a general reader.** It had been a developer quick-start, with a
tech-stack table, prerequisites, a clone command, two local-server recipes, an environment-variables
section, a per-script command reference and deploy instructions. All of that is gone from the README.
It now carries the project name and a short description, the live site link, what the site offers,
who it is for, what it is not, current status, and a table pointing at the three documents in
`/docs`. **This reverses the rule PRD Section 18 previously stated**, on an explicit instruction from
the owner, and the reversal is written up as a reversal rather than quietly applied. Nothing was
lost: every operational detail removed already lived in PRD Sections 10 and 11. Two stale counts died
with it, the README having claimed both 28 and 29 strategies in the same file, along with a
"Hosting: GitHub Pages" row that stopped being the whole truth when Cloudflare became canonical. The
`## License` section claiming MIT was also removed, because **there is no LICENSE file in the
repository**; that is now PRD discrepancy 4 and risk 4 rather than an unsupported claim on the front
page.

**`docs/PRD.md` grew from 2,854 to roughly 3,900 lines.** Seven sections were added: 20 Metrics,
21 Conventions, 22 Deprecation and Removal, 23 Working Practice, 24 Documentation Versus Reality,
25 Risks and Open Questions, and 26 Press Release. Section 14 gained a statement of the current phase,
a milestone table covering V1.0 through V4.0, and an explicit list of deferred items so none of them
reads as an oversight. Section 17's FAQ was replaced with 22 user questions and 12 internal ones.
Fifteen in-place corrections were merged rather than overwritten, each keeping the original text and
recording the observed reality beside it.

**`docs/DESIGN.md` went from 801 to 1,030 lines.** The `640px` breakpoint table was missing entirely
and is now documented. Six shared components that exist in `css/main.css` but had never been written
up were added. A new section documents the three tool pages' inline `<style>` blocks, roughly 250
lines of CSS living outside the design system, including the `.j-*` JSON highlighter duplicated
across two pages. The `--color-disabled` conflict was resolved with in-repo evidence: the doc said
`#444444`, the CSS says `#c0c0c0`, and the v1.5.4 patch note records that change as a deliberate
legibility fix, so the code was right and the document had been stale for two months.

**Counts were re-derived rather than carried forward, and several had drifted.** The glossary is 20
entries, not 8. `data/prices.json` covers 72 tickers from 2010, not 37 from 2018. The curated library
is 31 strategies. The community database holds 6,669 entries, against the 6,640 the document had
been repeating.

**Two live findings, both from fetching the sites rather than reading the configs.** GitHub Pages
serves the entire raw repository: `docs/PRD.md`, `README.md`, `scripts/check_live.py` and the 22.8MB
`data/symphony_scores.json` all return 200 with byte counts matching the working copy, which means
the exclusion list in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is inert. Separately, `.assetsignore` does not
list `symphony_scores.json`, so Cloudflare serves it too. Nothing secret is exposed, but a stated
boundary is not being enforced on either host. Both are logged as risks; neither is fixed in this
release, because fixing them changes deploy behaviour and that is its own change.

**Also found and logged, not fixed:** `robots.txt` advertises a sitemap that does not exist, and
`data/database_summary.json` holds 6,665 rows against `database.json`'s 6,669, so four symphonies are
invisible on the site until `export_summary.py` is re-run.

### Chore: project-wide em-dash sweep, 304 found in 13 files

The prohibition in PRD Section 19 had been in force since v1.7.2 and had not been swept since. **304
instances across 13 files**, of which 268 were editable and 265 were replaced: 167 plus 2 entity
forms in `docs/PRD.md`, 78 plus 2 in `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`, 8 in `converter.html`, 4 in
`etf-cloner.html`, 2 each in `data/strategies.json` and `data/strategies.js`, 1 each in
`signal-miner.html`, `docs/DESIGN.md` and `database.html`. Four `U+FFFD` characters in `docs/PRD.md`,
mangled em-dashes left behind by an earlier sweep, were repaired in the same pass. Replacements
followed the existing rule: a colon after a bold or code label or a closing parenthesis, a comma for
a mid-sentence aside.

**Two categories were deliberately left alone and are now recorded as permanent exceptions.** The 36
instances in `data/database.json`, `data/database.js` and their two summary twins are third-party
symphony names written by Composer users; editing them would misrepresent what their authors called
them and would break the correspondence with Composer.trade. The three in `converter.html` are not
punctuation at all, they are the empty-value placeholder glyph printed into a table cell when a
symphony has no name, rebalance setting or indicators. A future sweep should expect 39 surviving
instances and investigate any other number rather than driving it to zero.

### Docs: duplicate and out-of-order version numbers annotated in place

Three defects in this file's own history were found and marked where they sit, without renumbering
or reordering anything, per the rule in PRD Section 22 that historical records are annotated rather
than rewritten. `[1.15.5]` appears twice, both dated 2026-08-15. `[1.5.8]` appears twice, once
correctly on 2026-06-15 and once on 2026-07-09 nearly a month after the 1.13.x releases. `[1.15.0]`
sits below the whole 1.16.x block and above `[1.15.5]`, breaking newest-first order in both
directions. Each now carries a dated note explaining what is wrong with it and which field to trust.

## [1.24.8] - 2026-08-22

### Two finished one-shot scripts removed

`scripts/import_full_database.py` and `scripts/add_original_tag.py` are gone. Both were one-time scripts that had already done their one job, and neither was reachable from anything the site serves.

`import_full_database.py` bootstrapped `data/database.json` out of `data/Full Database.xlsx` back in v1.9.0. `database.json` has been the canonical source ever since, maintained by `refresh_full_database.py` and the flag/purge/sync scripts. Keeping it around was not neutral: its column layout expected the original scrape-format spreadsheet, `export_full_database_to_xlsx.py` has written a different layout since v1.9.4, and the two never got reconciled. So the script was a loaded gun aimed at the live dataset, one that would overwrite 6,640 entries with a stale, mis-parsed import and, per the v1.11.3 race-condition note, could do it silently while a refresh was running.

`add_original_tag.py` performed three renames, added the `original` glossary entry and applied the `original` tag to four strategies, in July. Verified before deleting: all three names carry the `(Original)` suffix in `data/strategies.json`, the glossary entry is present, and all four strategies carry the tag. The script's output is the committed data.

**What moved with them.** The generated banner in `data/database.js` told a future maintainer to run one of two scripts, one of which would no longer exist, so the five scripts that write that banner now name only `refresh_full_database.py`. The same correction went into `refresh_full_database.py`'s clobber warning, the README script table, and the repo structure map in `docs/PRD.md`. Completed roadmap entries and older patch notes describing work on either script were left alone, since they are an accurate record of what happened at the time rather than a claim about what exists now.

`data/Full Database.xlsx` stays. It has had no importer since v1.9.0 in practice; it is an offline snapshot written by the export script and read by nothing.

## [1.24.7] - 2026-08-21

### Settings survive a refresh, and both floors are entered as percentages

Three changes to section 3, all of them things the tool should probably always have done.

**The settings persist.** Combine signals, min signal period, Min Time in Market, Max Drawdown floor, prune quantile and CPU load are all restored on your next visit, from their own `localStorage` key alongside the one the ticker selection already used. **This reverses a deliberate earlier decision.** Until now only the tickers persisted, on the reasoning that CPU load and the filters govern how heavy a run is and should stay a conscious choice rather than something inherited from a forgotten session. The argument that won: tuning six controls and then losing them to a refresh is lost work for a reason nobody can see, and the Default button covers the case the old rule was protecting.

One consequence worth stating plainly, because the interface will not: **if you leave CPU load on Low, every future run is slow and the control looks exactly the same as if you had just chosen it.** Default puts it back.

**Both floors are percentages now, and drawdown is unsigned.** Min Time in Market reads `15` rather than `0.15`, and Max Drawdown floor reads `69` rather than `-0.69`. Typing a minus sign in front of a number already called a floor was a small permanent papercut. Nothing about the filtering changed: the values are divided by 100 and the drawdown negated before they reach the comparison, which still runs against the fractions the result store holds.

A related fix found while moving the units: an unparseable floor used to produce `NaN`, and every comparison against `NaN` is false, so the results table silently emptied. It now falls back to admitting everything, on the principle that a filter which cannot be read should not be the strictest filter in the tool.

**Signal families persist as well**, and are stored as a list of the families that are switched ON rather than as a map of all of them. The difference shows up on the day a new family is added: an absent id reads as OFF, so a returning visitor gets the new family switched off and opts into it, instead of finding every run suddenly larger for a reason nothing on the page explains. Default puts the families back to the shipped set along with everything else.

**New defaults**, and the Default button restores all of them:

| Setting | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Min signal period | 10d | 10d |
| Min Time in Market | 0.05 | **15%** |
| Max Drawdown floor | -0.8 | **69%** |
| Prune quantile | 0 | 0 |
| CPU load | Medium | **High** |

The two floors are meaningfully stricter, so it is worth knowing what they actually cost: measured on a default run, **36,523 displayed rows under the old floors against 35,706 under the new ones**, about 2%. Tightening two filters at once looks like it should be dramatic and is not.

**Under the hood**, the defaults used to be written out in three separate places with a comment asking whoever changed one to remember the other two. They are now a single `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` object, with the HTML attributes carrying the same values so the controls are right before any script runs, and a new `settings` harness asserts the two agree. That harness is also the first to use the two-Edge-invocation pattern the rig always supported and nothing had exercised: it writes settings in one browser process and reads them back in a **genuinely new one**, which is the only honest way to test that a refresh works.

## [1.24.5] - 2026-08-21

### The large-batch dialog tells you how long the run will take

The confirm that appears above 1,200,000 signals used to warn that "your browser may be slow or unresponsive" and that the run would take "several minutes". Both were written when memory was what a big run threatened. It is not any more: the v1.24.4 measurements put a maximal run at about a quarter of the tab's heap ceiling. What a big run costs now is time, and the dialog said almost nothing about it.

It now leads with a projected duration, computed from the measured 23 ns per spec-target-day and divided by the duty of the CPU setting actually selected. At Medium, a 1,321,440-signal run against one target over 3,904 days reads:

> This run will test 1,321,440 signals against 1 target over 3,904 days.
>
> At the medium CPU setting that is roughly 9m 55s. The estimate is from measured throughput on one machine, so treat it as a ballpark; the run shows a live time-remaining figure once it starts. There is no cancel button, so stopping early means reloading the page and losing the results.

**Two things it now admits that it did not.** That the estimate comes from one machine and is a ballpark, since the visitor's hardware is unknown and a projection dressed up as a fact would be worse than no projection. And that **there is no way to cancel a run**: the only exit is reloading the page and losing the results. That is worth knowing before agreeing to thirty minutes, and the old text let you find it out the hard way.

The advice line now includes raising the CPU setting, which is the one lever that makes a run finish sooner without making it smaller.

**A known bias, in the wrong direction.** The projection divides by the *nominal* duty, and v1.24.3 established that Max delivers nearer 64% than the 80% on its label. So at Max the dialog reads low. A warning that under-promises is the wrong way round, but the live time-remaining readout is measured rather than projected and takes over within a few seconds of clicking through.

## [1.24.4] - 2026-08-21

### The memory ceiling and the real speed of a run, both measured

Roadmap item 3 asked where the memory ceiling now sits after v1.22.13, v1.22.15 and v1.23.0 cut what a run retains. It does not sit anywhere near a run any more, and finding that out turned up a worse problem in the other direction.

**Memory.** A genuinely maximal run, meaning the 51 tickers with full history rather than all 72, is 2,064,072 specs and 1,886,073 stored rows over a 3,904-day sample. It peaks at **977 MB against a 4,192 MB heap ceiling, about 24%**. Selecting all 72 tickers looks bigger and is not: IBIT and ETHA cover roughly 30% of the date axis, so including them collapses the shared sample window to 270 days and every stored row gets cheaper. The old crash point near 2,000,000 signals is gone.

The ceiling itself read 4,192 MB here against 3,586 MB when it was last recorded, on the same machine. It is a property of the browser build, not the hardware, and it moves between versions.

**Speed, and a correction.** The v1.24.2 note published a table built on **4.5 nanoseconds per spec-target-day**. That figure was wrong by a factor of five, and it was wrong for a reason worth stating: it came from `performance.now()` readings taken inside a headless driver running under `--virtual-time-budget`, where the page clock is paused during synchronous compute and fast-forwarded through idle gaps. The same driver reported 1,154 ms of elapsed time for a run that really took 3.68s and 4,095,136 ms for one that really took 9.44s.

Timing now happens outside the browser. Four run sizes, each launched in real time with no virtual time and no `--dump-dom`, reporting through the console so the parent process can timestamp it:

| Compare tickers | Specs | Work | Run | ns per unit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 91,232 | 358,632,992 | 9.48s | 26.45 |
| 16 | 268,992 | 1,057,407,552 | 26.21s | 24.79 |
| 24 | 533,280 | 2,096,323,680 | 49.97s | 23.84 |
| 32 | 884,096 | 3,475,381,376 | 81.06s | 23.32 |

Linear across a tenfold range: **23 ns per spec-target-day unthrottled, plus about 1.7s of fixed cost per run.** So the corrected picture of what the warning thresholds mean, at Medium:

| Specs | Unthrottled | At Medium (20%) |
|---|---|---|
| 91,232 (8 tickers, default families) | ~10s | ~50s |
| 600,000 (**yellow**) | ~56s | ~4.6 min |
| 1,200,000 (**confirm**) | ~110s | ~9.1 min |
| 3,936,096 (all 72 tickers) | ~356s | ~30 min |

The thresholds themselves are unchanged and still land sensibly. What changed is what they are guarding: **not the tab's memory, but the afternoon.** The confirm dialog's wording still talks about the browser becoming slow, which is now the smaller of the two costs. Rewording it is a separate, small follow-up.

**No page behaviour changed in this release.** The corrections are to comments in `signal-miner.html`, to the roadmap, and to the harness documentation, plus a new `scripts/measure_throughput.py` and a rewritten `scripts/harness/throughput.js`. The memory harness no longer prints a timing column at all, because the only honest value it could print is nothing.

**Files changed:** `signal-miner.html`, `scripts/measure_throughput.py`, `scripts/harness/throughput.js`, `scripts/harness/memory.js`, `scripts/harness/_edge.py`, `scripts/harness/README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.24.3] - 2026-08-21

### The run status line reports measured CPU duty, not the nominal figure

While a backtest runs, the status line used to print the duty the throttle was *asked* for. It now prints the fraction of wall time actually spent computing, accumulated across every batch since the run started.

At High, Medium and Low the two agree. At **Max** they do not: the throttle sleeps `busy * FACTOR` between batches, and with `FACTOR` at 0.25 the requested sleep is frequently shorter than the roughly 4ms floor a browser applies to a nested `setTimeout`, so real idle runs longer than asked and delivered CPU lands nearer 64% than the 80% on the label. Garbage collection pauses and a backgrounded tab push it the same way.

The error has always been in the safe direction, delivering *less* CPU than advertised rather than more, which is why this sat on the list for a long time. It is fixed now because showing a number known to be wrong is not defensible when the true one costs a single accumulator. The first five batches still show the nominal figure prefixed with `~`, because a duty measured over one batch is noise.

**The CPU ceilings themselves are unchanged and stay that way.** They are capped for heat, on hardware belonging to whoever opens the page. The dropdown labels still describe what is requested; the status line now describes what is delivered.

## [1.24.2] - 2026-08-21

### The large-batch warning fires on large batches again

`SIGNAL_WARN_CAP` (100,000, which triggers the confirm dialog) and the 45,000 yellow-text threshold were set when a default eight-ticker run was about 20,000 signals. After v1.23.1 that same ordinary run was 100,696 and tripped the "this is a very large batch" dialog **every single time**, which is the fastest way to train someone to click through the one warning that matters.

> **Correction (v1.24.4).** The 4.5 ns/unit figure and the table below it are wrong by a factor of five. They were derived from a page clock running under `--virtual-time-budget`, which does not measure elapsed time. The thresholds themselves are unchanged and still land in the right place; see v1.24.4 for the real numbers and for why the measurement was invalid.

They are now **600,000** for the yellow estimate line and **1,200,000** for the confirm, and unlike last time the numbers come from a measurement. Pass 1 performs one backtest per spec, target and day; timed in headless Edge with the throttle disabled that inner loop runs at roughly **4.5 nanoseconds per unit of work**. Against a typical 3,930-day sample with one target:

| Specs | Compute | At Medium (20%) |
|---|---|---|
| 91,232 (8 tickers, default families) | ~1.6s | ~8s |
| 390,320 (20 tickers) | ~6.9s | ~34s |
| 600,000 (**yellow**) | ~11s | ~53s |
| 1,200,000 (**confirm**) | ~21s | ~1.8 min |
| 3,936,096 (all 72 tickers, default families) | ~70s | ~5.8 min |
| 4,931,064 (all 72, all sixteen families) | ~87s | ~7.3 min |

So an ordinary run says nothing, a large one turns yellow, and only a genuinely long one asks first. The confirm text now also names the target count and suggests raising the min signal period, which is the cheapest lever most people miss.

**A known blind spot, stated rather than hidden.** These are spec counts, not units of work. Pass 1 also scales with the number of targets and with sample length, so a three-target run does three times the work at the same spec count and will not warn any earlier. Projecting wall time directly would fix that. It was considered and deliberately not built: the estimate is currently a quantity that is *exact*, and turning it into a prediction that varies with the visitor's hardware is a bigger change than this item called for.

## [1.24.1] - 2026-08-21

### Indicator warm-up is charged to the sample window, so every row is scored on the same days

Every indicator needs `p` days of history before it produces a value. A 252-day signal is therefore blank, and so out of the market, for its first 252 days, while a 5-day signal is live after five. Until now all of them were scored over the same nominal span regardless.

**That was not a rounding error, it was a ranking bias.** A 252-day signal had 247 fewer days than a 5-day signal in which to earn return, against the same target, competing for the same leaderboard slot. Long windows were systematically penalised and the leaderboard tilted short. Since v1.23.0 standardised every family onto one grid reaching 252 days, this applied to all sixteen families rather than the two it used to.

The sample window now starts after the longest window in the active grid. A default run over tickers with full history goes from starting 2010-02-11 to starting **2011-01-03**, and from 4,183 scored days to **3,931**: a cost of 252 days, about **6.0%** of the sample, in exchange for rows that are actually comparable.

**The cost is shown, not hidden.** The estimate line now reads `sample 2011-01-03 to 2026-08-20 (3,931 days, 252 lost to warm-up)`, and the results meta line says `after 252 days of indicator warm-up so every row is scored on the same days`. The "not enough shared history" error also accounts for it, so a short-history ticker now fails with an explanation that names the warm-up rather than an unexplained day count.

**The alternative was considered and rejected.** Starting each spec at its own first valid day wastes no data, but it makes rows non-comparable in a different way, since each would be scored over a different period, and it would push a per-spec branch into the hottest loop in the tool. Comparability is what a leaderboard needs.

One deliberate detail: the `frac` figure behind the "limited by TICKER" hint still measures the ticker-driven share of the axis and excludes the warm-up, so that hint keeps pointing at the chip the user did not mean to include rather than firing on every run.

### Verified

Two live end-to-end runs in headless Edge at min periods 10 and 252. In both, `win.warm` equals the longest active window, `s0` equals the listing index plus the warm-up, `len` equals `N - s0`, 100 rows render, and both the estimate line and the meta line name the warm-up cost.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-08-21

### The three price-scale comparison families no longer pair across tickers

`map_cmp`, `ema_cmp` and `stdp_cmp` compare **dollar magnitudes**. "MA-Price(21d) of SPY > MA-Price(21d) of QQQ" is not a signal, it is a statement about share prices. Those three families now only pair a fast window against a slow window **on the same ticker**, which is the golden cross and the entire reason the families exist. The other five comparison families (`rsi_cmp`, `cum_cmp`, `ma_cmp`, `std_cmp`, `dd_cmp`) are scale-free and are deliberately untouched.

**The reason is not the one we expected, and the measurement changed the argument.** The working assumption was that cross-ticker price pairs are constant, never separating a day. Measured across all 72 tickers from 2010 to 2026 at four windows, that is only true of **42.5%** of them. The real problem is that they are **inert**:

| Family | Cross-ticker pairs | Same-ticker pairs |
|---|---|---|
| `map_cmp` | median **1** flip, 94.5% flip fewer than 12 times | median 51 flips, 7.4% inert |
| `ema_cmp` | median **1** flip, 94.3% flip fewer than 12 times | median 53 flips, 8.3% inert |
| `stdp_cmp` | median 9 flips, 54.1% flip fewer than 12 times | median 26 flips, 26.4% inert |
| `rsi_cmp` (control) | median 212 flips, 2.5% inert | median 455 flips, 0.0% inert |
| `cum_cmp` (control) | median 223 flips, 1.5% inert | median 134 flips, 1.2% inert |

A *flip* is a day where the condition changes state. The median cross-ticker price pair changes state **once in sixteen years**. That is a date wearing a condition's clothes, "before and after 2018", and a rule that fires on a single regime break is the purest form of over-fit this tool can produce. The two scale-free controls flip hundreds of times, which is what confirms the effect is about price scale rather than about comparison families in general.

**What it costs and what it saves.** `map_cmp` goes from 875,160 specs to **11,232** at 72 tickers with the 10-day floor. A default run drops from 4,800,024 signals to **3,936,096**, a saving of 863,928 or **18.0%**, and every one of those specs was previously paid for in full and then self-pruned at the end of Pass 1. Enabling all sixteen families drops from 7,522,848 to 4,931,064.

**`stdp_cmp` has the weakest case of the three** (54% inert rather than 94%) and it is recorded as such. The restriction is a per-family `same: true` flag rather than a blanket rule, so if a real signal ever turns out to be missing, that is the first flag to flip.

### Verified

425 lockstep cases across five ticker counts and five window floors: `countSpecs()` matches `buildSpecs().n` exactly for every family and for all sixteen combined. Every spec built for a `same` family was confirmed to carry the same ticker index on both sides. All sixteen families still produce identical boolean series through the object and columnar evaluation paths.

## [1.23.2] - 2026-08-21

### Added The Gold Miner (Original) to curated strategies library and full database

Added "The Gold Miner (Original)" (symphony ID `tlDwKY3NRXjYU61jCt0g`) to both `data/strategies.json` (curated library, now 31 entries) and `data/database.json` (full database, now 6,668 entries). This is plaindamnscared's original Gold Miner algorithm with GLD substituting for BIL as the defensive holding. Four-state rotation: GDXU RSI(10) > 79 routes to GDXD, RSI(10) < 30 routes to GDXU, then QQQ/TLT momentum comparisons route between GDXU and GLD. Stats: 697% ARR, 72,872x cumulative return over 5.4 years, 47.6% max drawdown, 2.76 Sharpe, 14.64 Calmar. Tags: `rsi`, `momentum`, `leveraged-etfs`, `inverse-etfs`, `original`.

## [1.23.1] - 2026-08-20

### Every level grid is uniformly stepped, and the two that can afford it got much finer

The v1.23.0 grids were hand-written ladders that thinned out at their extremes: the drawdown grid ran 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 20, so the top half of its range had half the resolution of the bottom. Every percent-quoted grid now steps by a constant amount across its whole range.

**Cumulative return and max drawdown step by one percentage point, over a bracket set from the data.** The step is now fixed, so resolution is constant and only the reach changes with the window.

The old brackets were `+/-10%` and `2%` to `20%` at 21 days: numbers that sound reasonable and, measured over all 72 tickers from 2010, are not. That cumulative-return grid covered only **75-81% of days**, and the drawdown grid **49-76%**. Drawdown missed at *both* ends: at 5 days its floor sat above the median, so nearly half the sample fell below the grid, while its ceiling sat below the 99th percentile. A threshold nothing ever crosses tests nothing.

The brackets now clear the 5th-to-95th percentile at every window, `+/-20%` and `1%` to `40%` at 21 days:

| Window | CumRet grid | Levels | MaxDD grid | Levels |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | -9% to +9% | 19 | 1% to 19% | 19 |
| 21 | -20% to +20% | 41 | 1% to 40% | 40 |
| 63 | -34% to +34% | 69 | 2% to 69% | 68 |
| 252 | **-69% to +69%** | **139** | **4% to 95%** | **92** |

Up from 11 and 8 fixed levels. Counting a level as *live* if it is between 5% and 95% true across the universe, the number of thresholds that actually split the sample went from 11 to 125 for cumulative return at 252 days, and from 8 to 70 for drawdown. The old levels were not dead, there were simply far too few of them.

Two caveats stated rather than hidden. The upside tail runs fatter than `sqrt(t)` predicts because leveraged funds compound (252-day cumulative return reaches +2311% in this universe), so no finite grid brackets it; the extremes stay reachable through the comparison families. And drawdown is capped at 95%, since it is bounded by construction and almost no day sits beyond that.

**Standard deviation of return and moving average of return could not take a percentage-point step, and that is a real constraint rather than an oversight.** Their entire useful range is narrower than one such step: daily volatility runs about 0.2%/day for a quiet bond fund to 6%/day in a panic, and mean daily return about +/-0.5%/day. A 2-point grid would have collapsed each family to two or three levels. They carry the equivalent *resolution* in their own units instead: volatility steps by 0.1 percentage points (59 levels, up from 9), mean return by 0.02 (51 levels, up from 9, roughly 5% a year per step).

The constraint is confined to those two families. Every family supplies its own level function, so it places no limit on how fine cumulative return or drawdown can go.

**Why this is affordable.** At 72 signal tickers with the 10-day floor, the five compare families are **91% of the search** at 875,160 specs each. All four level families together are 8.8%. Level families are *linear* in the level count while compare families square with tickers times windows, so doubling every level grid costs a couple of percent, whereas adding a single window to the grid would raise five comparison families at once.

A default run at 72 tickers is now 4,800,024 signals, up from 4,508,712: a **6.5% increase** for 3x to 11x more thresholds that separate anything.

**Also fixed:** grids are declared in percent and generated on an integer lattice of hundredths of a percentage point, so repeated addition cannot drift into values like 0.30000000000000004, and endpoints snap inward to the step lattice so every window's levels land on the same round numbers rather than on fifteen offset sets.

### Verified

Re-ran the full v1.23.0 suite in headless Edge. The shared counter still matches `buildSpecs` exactly across 99 cases; all sixteen families still produce identical boolean series via the object and columnar paths, with well-formed labels and Composer JSON; the grouped family controls, a live run and a snapshot round trip all still correct.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-08-20

### The Signal Miner searches a much larger, and much more evenly spaced, space

Three changes that belong together: one window grid instead of four, finer level grids, and every Composer function now reachable as a family.

**One window grid.** Each family used to carry its own inherited list of periods, four lists that had quietly drifted apart. Every family now reads the same fifteen windows: **5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 21, 26, 30, 42, 50, 63, 100, 126, 200, 252**. They are log-uniform, no two closer than 15%, because what a window tells you scales with its *ratio* to the next one, not the gap. Every value earns its place: one week, the short-RSI cluster, two weeks (the most used window in the strategy library, 137 occurrences), the two MACD legs, Wilder's 14, one month, two months, the golden-cross leg, one quarter, six months, Faber's 200-day trend gate and one year.

20, 60 and 189 were considered and dropped: they sit within 6% of 21, 63 and 200, produce an almost identical daily series, and cost exactly as much as any other window in a family that scales with the *square* of the grid. The Min signal period dropdown is now exactly this list, so picking a floor can no longer round you to a window the grid does not contain.

**RSI levels step by 2 instead of 10.** 10 to 90 in twos is 41 levels, up from nine. This is close to free: a "vs level" family costs `tickers x windows x levels x 2`, which is **linear** in the level count, unlike the compare families which square with the window count. The finer grid adds about 1.2% to a maximal run and removes the case where seven identical-looking rows were really the same signal at levels that never separated.

**Level grids for cumulative return and drawdown now scale with the window.** A 10% move over 5 days and a 10% move over 252 days are not the same event. Measured on TQQQ 2010-2026, the old fixed +/-10% cumulative-return grid left only **12% of days inside the grid at 252 days**, meaning most of its levels were pinned true or false for the whole sample and tested nothing. Those two grids are now quoted at 21 days and scaled by `sqrt(window / 21)`: +/-4.9% at 5 days, +/-10% at 21, +/-34.6% at 252. Mean daily return and daily volatility are *not* scaled, because they estimate a per-day rate that a longer window measures more steadily rather than larger.

RSI is not scaled either. It was tried, and it failed for a stated reason: scaling assumes the distribution is symmetric about 50, and a trending asset sits above 50 for years at a time, so the scaled grid drifted off the part of the range that actually separates days.

**Six families became sixteen, covering all nine Composer functions.** Every function in Composer's condition dropdown is now mineable: current price, cumulative return, RSI, moving average of price, moving average of return, exponential moving average of price, standard deviation of price, standard deviation of return, and max drawdown.

Eleven are on by default: RSI vs level, RSI vs RSI, cumulative return vs level, cumulative return compare, moving average of return compare, std dev of return compare, std dev of return vs level, price vs its own moving average, moving average of price compare, price vs its own EMA, and max drawdown vs level. The other five (EMA of price compare, EMA vs moving average, moving average of return vs level, max drawdown compare, std dev of price compare) are off because they are expensive or rarely productive, not because they do not work.

Section 2 is now grouped **Price / Return / Risk**, each group with an **All** toggle, plus row-level Default, Select all and Clear, deliberately the same shape as the ticker chips in section 1. A counter shows how many of the sixteen are on, and every checkbox carries a tooltip saying what it compares and how its cost scales.

**Sizing, so you can plan a run.** At 72 signal tickers with the 10-day floor, the eleven default families produce **4,508,712 signals**; all sixteen produce 7,152,912; dropping the floor to 5 days takes the default set to 5,979,960. The old six families produced 3,042,720 at the same settings, so standardising the grid roughly paid for the ten new families.

### Under the hood

**Specs are stored as columns.** v1.22.15 did this to the results and named the spec list as the next largest item; this is that. Five million specs as JavaScript objects was roughly 300 MB of the tab's ~3.5GB ceiling, held for the whole run. Seven typed arrays cost 10 bytes per spec instead, with nothing for the garbage collector to trace, and a spec object is built only where one is genuinely needed: labels, the Composer export, the survivors fed into pairing, and the snapshot. Pass 1 also reuses one signal buffer rather than allocating an array per spec.

**The pre-run estimate and the run now share one counter.** `estimate()` used to hand-mirror the arithmetic inside `buildSpecs()`, two copies that had to be kept in step by hand. They are one function now, so the number shown before a run and the number the run tests cannot drift.

**A latent bug fixed on the way in.** The new price-based indicators read a `NaN`-filled copy of the close series rather than the raw one. The raw array holds `null` before a ticker listed, and the rolling helpers guard with a NaN test that a `null` slips straight past, which would have made a moving average of price silently treat pre-listing days as zero. Return-based indicators were never exposed to this.

### Verified

Driven end to end in headless Edge. The shared counter matched `buildSpecs` exactly across 99 cases (every family, three period floors, several ticker counts, and all families at once). For all sixteen families, the object path and the columnar path produce identical boolean series, and each emits a well-formed label, condition and legacy flat block. The grouped family controls were exercised and report the right counts. A live run and a snapshot round trip both render correctly.

## [1.22.15] - 2026-08-20

### Results are stored as columns, so a large run holds half the memory

An owner report from a second machine: the run finished faster but the tab died with a memory error. That machine has 48GB of RAM, which is the useful clue, because the limit was never the machine's.

**A browser tab has its own heap ceiling and it does not grow with installed memory.** Measured in Edge on that class of hardware: 3,586 MB. Whether the box has 8GB or 48GB, the tab gets the same allowance, and "Out of memory" is that allowance running out rather than Windows running short.

**What was filling it.** After v1.22.13 removed the survivor cache, the remaining cost was one JavaScript object per result. A 3,000,000-signal run produces about 2,500,000 of them, and each costs roughly 300 bytes: the object header and slack, eight separately heap-allocated doubles, and a label string built eagerly for every row when only the 100 on screen are ever read.

Results are now stored as columns. Eight `Float64Array`s for the metrics, a `Uint32Array` of spec indices and a `Uint8Array` of target indices: 69 bytes per row, flat, outside the object heap, with nothing for the garbage collector to trace. Row objects are built only where one is actually needed, which is the 100 rows displayed, the at-most-150 per target fed into pairing, and the saved snapshot. Labels are derived from the spec at that point instead of stored.

Two related savings came with it. Sorting used to build a throwaway object per row on every click; it now carries indices and materialises only the rows it keeps. And the Time-in-Market / Max Drawdown filter used to produce a second full array of row objects alongside the first, so a large run paid for its results twice; that is now a list of indices at four bytes per row.

**Measured on the same 3,042,720-signal run:**

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Peak JS heap | 1,144 MB | **527 MB** |
| Peak process memory | 2,459 MB | **1,502 MB** |
| Wall time | 140s | **110s** |

Against the tab ceiling that is roughly 2.2x more headroom, moving the crash point from about 7.8M retained rows to about 17M. The speedup is a side effect of not tracing millions of objects on every collection.

**One row per signal PER TARGET.** Worth knowing when sizing a run: the estimate line counts signals, deliberately, because the target count does not change how many conditions exist. Retention is not the same shape. Two targets on a 3M-signal run keeps up to 6M rows.

**Verified against the previous build.** Both were driven through an identical scripted session covering 47,163 results: the default sort, sorting by a text column and a numeric one, two text filters, a live re-filter, the single-row export, the combined ladder export and the baselines. Output was byte-for-byte identical, 25,088 characters. The snapshot round trip was tested separately, running once and reloading against the same profile so `localStorage` survived, since that path builds the result set differently. Also identical.

**Still on the table:** the `specs` array is now the largest single item at roughly 300 MB of the remaining 527 MB, about 3M small objects. Packing those the same way would take the heap to around 230 MB, but it touches `evalSpec`, `specLabel` and the exporter, so it was left out of this change.

## [1.22.14] - 2026-08-20

### Leverage and Inverse are now separate ticker groups

The Signal Miner's chip groups had one 22-ticker block called "Leveraged & inverse", the largest group on the page by a wide margin and the only one whose **All** button did not express anything anyone actually wants: it selected fifteen bull funds and seven bear funds in a single click.

It is now two groups:

- **Leverage (15)** TQQQ, QLD, SPXL, SSO, UDOW, SOXL, USD, TECL, RETL, FAS, LABU, TNA, YINN, TMF, GDXU
- **Inverse (7)** SQQQ, PSQ, SPXU, SH, SOXS, TMV, GDXD

Membership goes by direction rather than by multiple, so the 1x shorts SH and PSQ sit in Inverse next to the 3x ones.

**Factor & dividend is now Value & Dividend**, same six tickers (SPYV, VIG, VIGI, SCHD, SCHG, SPHB), owner's wording.

**Bonds & cash is now Bonds**, same ten tickers (TLT, IEF, IEI, SHY, SHV, LQD, BND, BNDW, BSV, BIL). BIL and SHV are the cash-like ones and still live here.

Only labels changed. The universe is still 72 tickers, no price series moved, and any saved selection is unaffected because selection is stored per ticker, not per group.

## [1.22.13] - 2026-08-20

### Large runs no longer fill memory, and the countdown stops lying

Two owner reports: the machine bogs down after about 2,000,000 signals, and the status line read "1 second left" at 2,100,585 of 3,050,000.

**Memory.** Pass 1 kept the day-by-day array of every surviving signal so pairing could AND them together later. At 4,183 bytes each, a 3,000,000-signal run held around 4GB at a 50% survival rate, which is where a browser tab's heap runs out. It also turned out to be almost entirely unused: pairing only ever reads the top 150 survivors per target, so on a run that size over 99.9% of what was retained was never read. Nothing is cached now. The handful of arrays pairing needs are rebuilt on the spot, which takes under a millisecond.

Re-filtering is still instant and results are unchanged. Retention was the cost, not the work.

**Countdown.** The estimate came from measured compute scaled by the CPU factor, which assumed idle time exactly matched what the throttle asked for. When real idle ran longer, through timer clamping, a backgrounded tab, or garbage collection, elapsed time overtook the projection and the countdown stuck at zero with a third of the run left. It now projects from actual throughput and shows "estimating..." for the first five batches.

**Verified by running it.** Both builds were driven through the same 3,042,720-signal run in a headless browser, with memory sampled from outside. Before: 14,264 MB peak and the run never finished. After: 2,747 MB peak, finished in 139 seconds. A smaller session that both builds could complete was compared row by row across every metric column and came out byte-for-byte identical, so the change affects memory only.

## [1.22.12] - 2026-08-20

### Batch size scales with the CPU level

Max 250, High 200, Medium 150, Low 100, replacing the uniform 150 from v1.22.11.

The reason is the `setTimeout` clamp. Browsers round a nested timer's delay up to roughly 4ms, and the throttle sleeps for `busy x FACTOR`, so a level with a small factor on a small batch asks for a sub-clamp sleep, gets rounded up, and holds less CPU than its label claims. A larger batch at the faster levels makes the requested sleep clear the clamp.

Max is still short of its nominal 80%, landing near 64%, because closing that gap fully would need a batch around 550, which is where Max was when it was crashing browsers. The error only ever runs toward less CPU, so the readout overstates load rather than hiding it.

**Correction to the v1.22.11 note:** that entry claimed the old 500-signal batch was likely contributing to the crashes. The arithmetic does not support it. At roughly 29 microseconds per signal a 500-batch blocks for about 14ms, which is a long frame, not a hang. The uncapped duty cycle and the documented memory ceiling are the plausible causes; batch size in this range is not.

## [1.22.11] - 2026-08-20

### Lower CPU ceilings; Max no longer means 100%

Reported by the owner: the Max setting was crashing browsers. It ran with no throttle at all and, less obviously, on a batch of 500 signals where every other level used 150.

New targets, with the throttle factor derived from each one as `100/duty - 1` and checked to round-trip:

| Option | Was | Now | `FACTOR` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Max | 100% | ~80% | 0.25 |
| High | ~50% | ~40% | 1.5 |
| Medium (default) | ~25% | ~20% | 4 |
| Low | ~10% | ~10% | 9 |

Batch size is now a uniform 150 at every level. That matters as much as the percentage: the batch boundary is the only point the run yields to the browser, so the old 500 held the main thread for over three times as long between breaths.

Results are identical at every setting. Only speed and heat change.

## [1.22.10] - 2026-08-20

### Shorter progress line

The run status now ends at the time remaining: "Backtesting 3,042,720 signals... 303,000 (10%) · ~25% CPU · 5m 17s left". The projected total and the idle-time breakdown are gone. Both were only ever there to explain why a throttled run takes longer than its compute time, which the CPU percentage already implies.

The projection itself is unchanged, since the remaining figure is still derived from it.

## [1.22.9] - 2026-08-20

### The combine bar now says what a mixed-target ladder actually does

Raised by a Signal Miner user via the owner: selecting rows with different targets and exporting them as one Frontrunner is misleading, because the ladder buys only one thing.

That is correct about the behaviour. A ladder holds exactly one ticker on any given day, whichever branch fires first, so a selection spanning TQQQ, SOXL and TECL is a rotation between them, not a combined position. The bar counted the targets but never said what followed from that.

Selecting across targets is still allowed, since a deliberate rotation is a legitimate strategy. What changed is that a mixed-target selection now shows a line stating the ladder rotates rather than holds together, and that each row's metrics describe its own signal and target alone, not the rotation. Single-target selections show nothing new.

## [1.22.8] - 2026-08-20

## [1.22.7] - 2026-08-20

### The deploy now refuses to publish a broken page

Two checks moved into `scripts/` and into the deploy workflow, ahead of the build step. If either fails the deploy stops and the previously published site stays up.

`scripts/check_html_js.py` catches the v1.22.2 failure: a stray apostrophe inside a JS string that closes it early and kills the whole inline script, while the page still serves a healthy-looking 200 with its static HTML intact. It checks every inline `<script>` on the site for strings running past end of line and for unbalanced brackets, and it understands regex literals, which is what previously made it unusable on converter.html, database.html and etf-cloner.html. Confirmed against all 11 pages, and confirmed to fail on a copy with the outage deliberately reintroduced.

`scripts/check_composer_ladder.py` catches the v1.22.5 failure: output that is valid JSON but the wrong shape. It walks the combined export's tree asserting that every `if` has exactly two children and every else holds exactly one thing, and it guards against drifting from the real builder by pattern-matching the exporter in `signal-miner.html` first.

No change to the site itself.

## [1.22.6] - 2026-08-20

### Shorter data-refresh line, reworded export description

The line under the Signal Miner heading now reads "Data last refreshed Aug 20, 2026 · 72 tickers" and drops the trailing "through 2026-08-20". The full range, including the last close, is still spelled out in the data note further down the page.

The combined export's `description` was reworded to "Composer Atlas Signal Miner built this strategy. Branches are ordered by the Calmar ratio each signal scored standalone, holding cash when a signal is off." This drops the sentence warning that the chain itself has never been backtested, which was the last place that caveat appeared after v1.22.4 removed the paragraph under the combine bar. It stays recorded in the PRD.

**Files changed:** `signal-miner.html`, `docs/PRD.md`

---

## [1.22.5] - 2026-08-20

### Fix: the combined JSON export produced a symphony Composer would not take

The combined export built the wrong structure. It emitted a single `if` step holding every selected signal as a sibling branch, with the last one marked as the else. Composer does not work that way: an `if` step takes exactly two children, the condition branch and an else, and each further rung of a ladder is nested **inside** the previous rung's else.

The builder now recurses. The deepest else holds the cash proxy, and every else above it holds the next `if`. Priority is still Calmar descending, so the ladder reads the same way; only the shape it is written in changed.

The single-row export was never affected, because with one rung the flat and nested shapes are identical. That is also why this survived five versions: the verification port asserted the shape the builder produced rather than the shape Composer requires. The port now checks the invariant directly, that every `if` has exactly two children and every else holds exactly one thing.

Reported by the owner with a screenshot of a correctly formed Composer symphony.

## [1.22.4] - 2026-08-20

### A Default button, a shorter example label, and less text around the combine bar

The Target tickers row gains a **Default** button to the left of the example loader, which resets the whole form: TQQQ against QQQ, SPY, IWM and DIA, every signal family on, and all four filters back to their documented values. The example button is now labelled **Community V2 Example** rather than "Load community V2 example".

Both loaders now clear the cached run when they swap the ticker set. Previously loading a preset left the previous run's results in `sigCache`, so the live filter controls would keep re-filtering results that no longer matched the tickers on screen.

The explanatory paragraph under the combine bar is gone. The warning that a chained ladder has never been backtested as a whole still ships inside the exported symphony's `description`, which is where it reaches the person pasting it into Composer; the wording there no longer points at the removed note.

## [1.22.3] - 2026-08-20

### Buy-and-hold benchmarks lose their explanatory paragraph

The block of text under the benchmark row is gone. The numbers and the heading speak for themselves, and BIL posting a Calmar of 402 because cash has no drawdown is worth noticing on its own rather than being explained away.

**Files changed:** `signal-miner.html`, `docs/PRD.md`

---

## [1.22.2] - 2026-08-20

### Hotfix: Signal Miner would not load

A stray apostrophe in the text under the buy-and-hold benchmarks ("Ignore BIL's Sortino...") closed a JavaScript string early, which is a syntax error, which stopped the entire page script from running. The page rendered its static text and then did nothing: no ticker chips, no signal families, an empty min-period dropdown, and a status line stuck on "Loading price data...".

Introduced in v1.22.1 and fixed here. The wording now avoids the apostrophe entirely and is less preachy about it, since BIL posting a Calmar of 402 is funny and correct rather than something to scold the reader about.

**Files changed:** `signal-miner.html`

---

## [1.22.1] - 2026-08-20

### AND pairs are now built from the Calmar-ranked survivors

When Calmar became the default ranking in v1.22.0, one place still ranked by Sortino: the cut that decides which single signals get fed into AND pairing. Only the top 150 survivors per target are paired, so that cut was choosing candidates on one metric while the table ranked them on another.

It now ranks by Calmar, matching the table.

**This changes your results, not just their order.** A different set of survivors reaches the cap, so different AND pairs get generated in the first place, and some pairs that existed before will not appear. Single-signal rows are unaffected. This shipped as its own release rather than folded into v1.22.0 precisely so the change is visible.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-08-20

### Select several signals and export them as one symphony

Requested by Haverel Mink in the Composer Discord: *"What if you could write the frontrunner JSON from the results table, rather than building it one-by-one?"*

Every result row now has a **checkbox**. Tick as many as you like and hit **Copy combined JSON** to get a single Frontrunner-shaped symphony: one `if` block with a branch per signal and a cash fallback, ready to paste into Composer. No more exporting rows one at a time and stitching them together by hand.

**Branches are ordered by Calmar, highest first.** Ladder position is a real strategy decision, since the top branch pre-empts every branch below it on any day several fire, so the order is derived from the metric rather than from the order you happened to tick the boxes. That makes the export deterministic and means there is no list to drag around. A row with no finite Calmar sorts to the bottom instead of landing somewhere arbitrary.

Your selection survives sorting, filtering and the 100-row display cap, so a row can scroll out of view and still export.

**One thing to be clear about, and it is stated on screen too: the combined symphony has not been backtested.** Every row's metrics come from testing that signal alone, holding cash when it was off. Chaining several together produces a strategy nobody has measured, and a ladder of individually strong signals can easily be worse than any one of its parts. Treat the export as a starting point to test in Composer, not a finished strategy.

### Calmar is now the default ranking

The results table now sorts by **Calmar** instead of Sortino on load, and the saved snapshot keeps the top 100 by Calmar to match. Following the v1.21.0 fix, Calmar is annualized return over worst drawdown, so it is comparable across runs of different lengths and reads the way the term normally does: above 1.0 means a typical year's gain exceeds the worst peak-to-trough loss.

Snapshots saved before this release are discarded, since they were ranked by a different metric. One run rebuilds them.

### Buy-and-hold now compares against fixed benchmarks

The buy-and-hold strip used to show one row per target you had selected, so the yardstick moved every time you changed the selection and two runs could not be compared to each other. It now always shows the same four: **TQQQ, QQQ, SPY and BIL**.

BIL is there as the cash floor. It is what a signal earns while it is switched off, so anything that cannot beat it is not paying for its own complexity. One caveat now stated on screen: **ignore BIL's Sortino and Calmar.** Cash has almost no drawdown, and both ratios divide by drawdown, which inflates them to meaningless numbers (BIL scores a Calmar of 402 on a short window). Compare BIL on Total Return and Annualized only.

If a benchmark listed later than the window you are testing, the strip says "from" and the date rather than pretending it existed and sat flat.

### Load community V2 example moved

The button now sits in the Target tickers row, just left of Select all, instead of down by the Run button.

## [1.21.2] - 2026-08-20

### Eight duplicate ETFs removed from the ticker universe

The universe drops from **80 to 72 tickers**, making a select-all run about **19% lighter** in both compute and memory. Removed: **UPRO, VGSH, VGLT, VGIT, SOXX, VTV, SVIX, IJR**.

Every removal was a pair where two funds track the same thing, and in each case the **older fund was kept**: SPXL over UPRO, SHY over VGSH, TLT over VGLT, IEF over VGIT, SMH over SOXX, SPYV over VTV, SVXY over SVIX, and IWM over IJR. Redundant tickers are worse here than in an ordinary list, because signal count grows with the *square* of your selection and two near-identical funds produce near-identical "discoveries" that look like independent confirmation but are not.

**Several funds that look like duplicates were deliberately kept**, because they are not: SPY and VTI (S&P 500 vs total market), IEF and IEI (7-10 year vs 3-7 year treasuries), BND and BNDW (US vs world bonds), and QQQ and QQQE (cap-weighted vs equal-weighted). These move together day to day but hold genuinely different things, and that difference is exactly what a signal miner might be looking for.

If you had any of the removed tickers selected, your saved selection drops them automatically on next load. Nothing else changes, and the page is about 250KB lighter.

## [1.21.1] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed: target tickers were forced into your signal conditions

Choosing TECL as a target and XLK plus KMLM as signals still produced conditions measured on **TECL**, and there was no way to stop it. Signal Miner merged the two boxes into one pool before generating conditions, so the Signal set could only ever add tickers, never restrict them.

**Conditions now come from the Signal set only.** The Target set says what you hold; the Signal set says what gets measured. That is what the labels always implied.

Rules that read their own target, like *if RSI(TECL) > 79 then hold TECL*, are a common and legitimate Composer pattern and are **not** lost. You now ask for them by putting the ticker in **both** boxes, which produces exactly the same signals the old behavior did. The difference is that it is now your choice.

Two side effects worth expecting. Runs get **smaller**, sometimes a lot: three targets against two signals drops from 1,560 signals to 396, because targets no longer multiply into the condition pool. And if your Signal set is empty the run now stops with a message instead of silently scoring nothing.

The starting selection is unchanged: Target TQQQ with signals QQQ, SPY, IWM, DIA. Note this means the default no longer generates TQQQ-on-TQQQ conditions. Add TQQQ to the signal box if you want those back.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed: max drawdown was wrong, and it was hiding your best results

**Max drawdown has been wrong since Signal Miner shipped.** It measured the gap between current and peak value in *return units* instead of as a percentage of the peak. Those are the same number only while a strategy has barely moved. Once one compounds, the gap gets denominated in the grown balance and runs straight past -100%: buy-and-hold TQQQ over the new 2010 history reported **-16761%**, where the real figure is **-81.7%**. SPY reported -133.6% against a true -33.7%.

**This mattered more than it looks.** The Max Drawdown floor defaults to -0.8, and on the broken numbers anything that had compounded meaningfully fell below it. Both SPY and QQQ fail that filter on the old formula and pass on the correct one. The tool was quietly throwing away its strongest signals, and extending history to 2010 made it worse by giving returns more room to multiply. **If you have run backtests before, the results are worth running again.**

**Calmar was affected too**, and separately wrong: it divided *total* return by drawdown, so it grew simply with the length of the backtest. Buy-and-hold TQQQ scored 418 on the 2010 axis. It now uses annualized return over drawdown, the standard definition, giving TQQQ 0.52. Above 1.0 now means what it should: a typical year's gain exceeds the worst peak-to-trough loss. Calmar sorting will rank differently than before.

Also corrected: Time in Market was computed against a denominator one day off, showing 0.9998 instead of 1.0 for an always-active signal.

### New: a buy-and-hold line to measure signals against

Above the results table there is now a **buy-and-hold row for each target**, scored over the exact same window with the exact same maths. Every signal is a bet that being in the target *sometimes* beats being in it *always*, and until now there was nothing on screen to check that against. A 300% return reads like a discovery until you see that just holding the thing returned more, with no rules and no assumptions.

It does not sort, does not get filtered away, and does not take up one of the 100 result slots, because a fixed reference is only useful if it stays put.

Saved results from before this release are discarded rather than shown, since the drawdown and Calmar numbers in them are wrong. One run rebuilds them.

## [1.20.1] - 2026-08-20

### Price history now goes back to 2010, not 2018

Signal Miner's data set extends from **2018-01-02 back to 2010-01-04**: 4183 trading days instead of 2170, nearly doubling the history behind every backtest. This covers the entire leveraged-ETF era, since TQQQ, UPRO, SPXL, TNA, FAS and TMF all launched in 2010 or earlier, and adds the 2010 flash crash, the 2011 debt-ceiling selloff and the 2015-16 correction as testable regimes.

**A bug turned up while doing this.** The fetch script asked Yahoo for a fixed `range=10y` and then filtered to `START_DATE`, so the start date could only ever *narrow* that ten-year window, never widen it. Moving it back would have silently done nothing: the first attempt returned every ticker starting 2016-08-22, exactly ten years back, regardless of the setting. The script now sends explicit `period1`/`period2` bounds, so the requested window is the window you get.

Runs are correspondingly slower, since there is roughly twice as much history to score per signal. The page is now about 2.6MB of price data, up from 1.4MB.

Two things worth knowing. Fifty-five of the eighty tickers now have full coverage, and the rest list partway through, so the **common sample window matters more than it used to**: picking one recently listed fund still shortens the whole run to that fund's history, and the meta line under the table names whichever ticker is binding it. And as previously decided, **SVXY's pre-February-2018 history describes a different product** (it was a -1x fund before being reformed to -0.5x), so signals spanning that boundary are measuring a blend. In practice this affects SVXY alone: Yahoo's VXX is the Series B ETN and simply has no data before 2018, so there is nothing there to splice.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-08-20

### Annualized return added to the results table

The results table now has an **Annualized** column, sitting right after Total Return and sortable like every other metric. It answers the question Total Return cannot: a 400% gain reads very differently over eight years than over two.

It is a true CAGR, computed over the **run's sample window** rather than over days in market. A signal that sits in cash most of the time is not credited as though the idle stretches did not happen, because that flat time is part of what you actually earned.

Worth knowing before you sort by it: the sample window is the same for every row in a given run, so **Annualized ranks results in exactly the same order Total Return does.** It is there to make the size of a number readable, not to give you a second opinion on which signal is best. Sortino and Calmar remain the columns that rank differently. For the same reason it is deliberately left out of quantile pruning, where it would just apply the Total Return filter twice.

The saved-results snapshot carries the new column, and the storage key moved to `v2` so a snapshot saved before this release is discarded rather than restored with an empty Annualized column. One run rebuilds it.

**Files changed:** `signal-miner.html`, `docs/PRD.md`

## [1.19.1] - 2026-08-20

### Your last results are still there when you come back

Signal Miner now saves the **top 100 rows by Sortino** from your last run, locally in your browser, and shows them when you return instead of an empty table. The sample window, the result count and the run date come back with them, and **Copy JSON still works** on every saved row.

One deliberate limitation, stated plainly on screen rather than hidden: **sorting is disabled on restored results.** Only the rows you can see are saved, not the millions behind them, because the full run holds hundreds of megabytes of signal data that no browser will store and that would take longer to reload than to recompute. Sorting the saved 100 would look like it worked while quietly ranking a subset instead of the whole run, so the column headers are greyed out until you run a backtest. The filter box still works, since narrowing what is on screen is honest.

As with the ticker selection, nothing leaves your browser.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed: short-history tickers were being scored unfairly

Signals built on a recently listed fund were penalised for history that fund never had.

Time in Market and the average return feeding Sortino were both divided by the length of the **entire** price history, back to 2018, even when the ticker involved did not list until much later. A fund with `null` prices before it existed cannot fire a signal there, so those days counted against it for nothing. IBIT covers about 30% of the history, which meant an IBIT signal could never report Time in Market above 0.30 no matter how well it actually traded.

Each run now picks a **common sample window**: it starts where the most recently listed of your selected tickers begins, and every signal in that run is scored over that same stretch. On a simulated ticker with 30% coverage, Time in Market corrected from 0.166 to 0.555, its true rate of 361 firing days out of the 650 available, and **Sortino had been understated by 70%**. Total return and max drawdown do not change, since the trades were always the same; only the denominators were wrong.

Two things follow from this, both now shown in the interface. Results are comparable within a run but **not between runs using different tickers**, so the window and the ticker that set it are stated with the results and in the pre-run estimate. And because one recent ticker shrinks the window for everything else, the estimate warns when your selection covers less than 60% of available history, and refuses to run below 30 shared days.

If you have been running signals on IBIT, ETHA, SVIX, KMLM, GDXU, GDXD or DBMF, your earlier results understated them. Worth re-running.

## [1.18.4] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed: every comparison signal was being generated twice

Reported from the results table, where four rows showed the identical signal with identical metrics. They were four spellings of one condition:

```
CumRet(10d) of SOXX < CumRet(10d) of SMH   AND   StdDev-Return(50d) of VOX > StdDev-Return(30d) of QQQE
CumRet(10d) of SOXX < CumRet(10d) of SMH   AND   StdDev-Return(30d) of QQQE < StdDev-Return(50d) of VOX
CumRet(10d) of SMH > CumRet(10d) of SOXX   AND   StdDev-Return(50d) of VOX > StdDev-Return(30d) of QQQE
CumRet(10d) of SMH > CumRet(10d) of SOXX   AND   StdDev-Return(30d) of QQQE < StdDev-Return(50d) of VOX
```

`X < Y` and `Y > X` say the same thing, and the signal builder was emitting both. It walked every ordered pair of tickers and emitted both directions for each, so every two-sided comparison existed twice, and every AND pair four times (two spellings per condition, squared).

Comparisons are now generated once per unordered operand pair, keeping both directions, which loses nothing: `Y > X` is still found, it just gets written `X < Y`. Same-ticker comparisons keep only the shorter window on the left, which also removes the degenerate case of comparing a series to itself, always false and previously backtested anyway. Fast-versus-slow comparisons on one ticker are real signals and are untouched.

**This makes runs roughly twice as fast and halves their memory**, since half of every search was spent rediscovering mirror images. At 80 tickers that is 7.47M signals down to 3.75M. The lower memory also raises the point at which a large run exhausts the tab.

Verified by running the old and new builders side by side and comparing every condition in canonical form: nothing lost, nothing added, no duplicates left. The pre-run signal estimate was updated to match, so it no longer reads about 2x high.

## [1.18.3] - 2026-08-20

### Signal Miner remembers your tickers

New defaults on a first visit: Target **TQQQ**, signals **QQQ, SPY, IWM, DIA**. Previously it opened on QQQ against KMLM/VIXM/TLT.

More usefully, the ticker selection now survives a refresh. Whatever you had picked comes back, stored locally in your own browser. Nothing is sent anywhere, consistent with the site collecting no user data at all.

Only the tickers persist. Signal families, CPU load and the filters reset each visit on purpose, since those decide how hard a run works your machine and are better as a deliberate choice than something inherited from a session you have forgotten about. Selections are checked against the current ticker list when restored, so a ticker removed from the universe later cannot leave a broken selection behind, and if you clear everything and refresh you get your cleared state back rather than having the defaults reimposed.

## [1.18.2] - 2026-08-20

### Results table no longer freezes on huge runs

Reported after a run left roughly 8 million rows cached: the browser locked up when displaying and re-sorting them.

The cause was not rendering. The table only ever drew a few hundred rows, but it got there by filtering, copying, and running a **full sort over every cached row** first, then slicing off the top. On millions of rows that allocated several large arrays and blocked the main thread for seconds, and it happened again on every single sort click.

Sorting is now a bounded selection: one linear pass keeps a buffer of just the rows that will be shown, rejecting most rows in a single comparison against the worst one kept. The full result set still lives in the cache and is still ranked across in its entirety, so sorting means the same thing as before; only the amount of ordering work changed. Verified against the old comparator across every sort column, both directions, with NaN values and heavy ties present.

The display cap is now **100 rows** (was 500), the results filter box is debounced 250ms rather than re-running on every keystroke, and filter matching no longer builds a throwaway lowercased string per row. For result sets above 200,000 rows the table now dims and shows a spinner while a pass runs, so a slow sort reads as working rather than crashed.

One known limit remains: changing the section-3 filters still rebuilds the result set synchronously, so those can still stall on a very large run.

## [1.18.1] - 2026-08-20

### Signal Miner progress shows time remaining

Long runs previously showed only a projected *total*, which meant working out how much longer to wait required watching the percentage and doing the arithmetic. The status line now leads with time remaining: `12m 35s left of ~12m 30s total (idle ~11m 15s)`.

Remaining is computed as projected total minus measured wall-clock elapsed, so the two figures always agree and the countdown is monotonic. Total itself is still projected from compute time scaled by the duty factor rather than from elapsed, which matters more than it sounds: at a batch boundary the current batch's sleep has not run yet, so projecting from elapsed would understate the total by the whole throttle factor on the first reading and then climb steadily, looking broken. Verified by simulating the loop across the Max, Medium and Low settings.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-08-20

### Signal Miner universe more than doubles, with grouped tickers and select-all

**80 tickers, up from 37.** The original list was inherited from a community tool and had real holes: one bond fund, no small caps, no developed international, no broad-market total-market fund. It now covers broad market, factor and dividend, sector, international, a full bond ladder, commodities and crypto, volatility and hedges, and leveraged and inverse, with 43 additions including SPXL, SMH, IWM, VTI, EFA, DIA, and the IEF/IEI/SHY/SHV/BND/BSV/VGSH/VGIT/VGLT bond set. Nothing was removed.

**Crypto arrives as ETFs, not spot.** IBIT and ETHA are included rather than BTC-USD and ETH-USD. Spot crypto trades weekends, which would have stretched the shared date axis from ~2,170 trading days to ~2,800 calendar days and silently redefined every existing signal, since window lengths count rows: `RSI(10)` would have become 10 calendar days with 2 in 7 missing. The ETFs trade the normal NYSE calendar, so the axis is unchanged. They are also real Composer assets, so "Copy JSON" still exports a valid symphony.

**Chips are grouped, with All buttons.** 80 chips in a flat row is unusable, so tickers are now grouped by asset class, each group has its own **All** toggle, and each row has a whole-universe select and a clear. Grouping is carried in `prices.json` as a new `group` field on each ticker, so the list and its grouping stay in one place.

**Limited-history tickers are flagged.** Seven funds list after the 2018 start (ETHA at 24% coverage, IBIT 30%, SVIX 51%, KMLM/GDXU/GDXD 66%, DBMF 84%). Their metrics are fit to a shorter sample, and the default Min Time in Market floor of 0.05 will not screen that out, so they now render with a dashed chip border and a "limited history" tooltip.

Selecting everything is heavy, by design rather than by accident: 80 tickers is roughly 8.2M signals before the target multiplier, well past the 100k warn threshold. The estimate readout and the existing confirm prompt both still apply.

## [1.17.1] - 2026-08-16

### Homepage curated count corrected, dedupe audit finding recorded

The homepage stats bar read **29 Curated** while `data/strategies.json` has held **30** entries for some time. The stats bar is hardcoded by design (loading the full database client-side just for five numbers would blow the homepage's page-weight target), which is exactly how it drifted. Corrected to 30 here and in the six places the PRD still said 29.

Also recorded a **known limitation of `dedupe_symphonies.py`** in the PRD: its keeper rule (longest `oos_date`, then earliest `symphony_id`) does not always keep the copy with the most watchers. A manual audit of 3 duplicate clusters found 2 agreed, but one kept an 8-watcher copy over a structurally identical 173-watcher sibling. Left as-is deliberately, since watcher count is a popularity signal rather than a correctness one and promoting it would trade away backtest length. This had been sitting in a loose spreadsheet rather than the docs; the two stray `.xlsx` working files in the repo root were removed once their contents were captured or confirmed redundant.

**Files changed:** `index.html`, `docs/PRD.md`

## [1.17.0] - 2026-08-15

### Leaderboard ranking in the Screener + tag filtering on the strategy index

Two features that make existing data usable rather than adding new data.

**Leaderboard Rank / Tier / Score in the Screener.** All three Screener views (Overview, Risk-Adjusted, Distribution) now carry sortable **Rank**, **Tier**, and **Score** columns, and the filter grid gains a **Leaderboard Tier** select with cumulative options ("S+ only", "S or better", … "C or better") that match the "Over X" threshold style of every other filter. Previously the Leaderboard's scoring and the Screener's filtering ignored each other entirely; now you can filter to, say, A-or-better and then screen those by drawdown and Sharpe in one pass. Scoring runs **once globally** over the full eligible pool and both tabs read the same index, so a symphony's rank and tier mean the same thing everywhere and do not shift as you filter. (Re-scoring within the filtered subset was considered and rejected: it would make the tier filter circular, since filtering to "S or better" would immediately re-tier the survivors.) Rows awaiting a metric refresh show a dash and drop out when a tier floor is set.

**Tag filtering on the strategy index.** The tags every strategy already carries are now clickable filters on `strategies.html` instead of read-only labels. They are grouped into Signal / Risk metric / Asset class / Collection, each chip shows how many strategies carry it, and only tags present in the data are offered. Selecting several combines them with **AND**, so each tag narrows the list further, and the header switches to "N of 30 strategies" while filtered. Selections are written to a **`?tags=` query param**, making a filtered view linkable and letting it survive a refresh or a back-navigation from a strategy detail page.

## [1.16.10] - 2026-08-15

### Signal Miner CPU load levels renamed; monetization removed from the roadmap

**CPU load levels renamed** to a single consistent intensity scale: **Max** (100% CPU), **High** (~50%), **Medium** (~25%, default), **Low** (~10%). Previously "Full speed / Balanced / Easy on CPU / Coolest", which mixed a speed scale with a heat scale. The percentages stay in the option text since the names are now abstract. The underlying option values were renamed to match (`max`/`high`/`medium`/`low`); the old values were a trap, because `eco` referred to the 25% tier and would have collided with an "Eco" label on the 10% tier. Behavior is unchanged.

**Monetization removed from the product plan.** The former V3.0 "Monetization Expansion" roadmap section (premium strategy tier, newsletter integration, performance alerts) is removed entirely rather than deferred, along with the Google AdSense goal and backlog item. Composer Atlas is free and unmonetized; the only funding channel is voluntary reader donations via Buy Me a Coffee, linked as Support in the nav and footer. Non-Goals now explicitly rule out ads, paid tiers, paywalled content, sponsored placement, email capture, and any user data collection, and Tenet 7 (Independence and Integrity) records the stance and the reason behind it.

**Files changed:** `signal-miner.html`, `docs/PRD.md`

## [1.16.9] - 2026-08-15

### Signal Miner CPU throttle reworked to a duty-cycle rate limiter with a time estimate

Reworked the **CPU load** control from fixed pauses to an adaptive **duty-cycle** limiter: after each batch the run idles for a multiple of the time that batch actually spent computing, so the processor holds a target busy fraction no matter how fast the machine is (heat tracks duty cycle, not absolute idle time). The four levels now map to a stable CPU-busy target: **Full speed (100%)**, **Balanced (~50%)**, **Easy on CPU (~25%, default)**, and a new **Coolest (~10%)** tier for maximum heat reduction. While a run is going, the status line now shows a live estimate of total run time and idle time (measured from actual compute so far), e.g. `... 12% · ~25% CPU · est. total 6m (idle ~4m)`. Results are unaffected; this only governs how hot and how fast the run goes.

**Files changed:** `signal-miner.html`

## [1.16.8] - 2026-08-15

### Signal Miner: default Prune quantile is now 0 (show everything)

Changed the default **Prune quantile** from `0.5` to `0` (in both the form and the example/reset preset), so a fresh run no longer trims any single signals before pairing them into combinations; all qualifying signals are shown by default. Raising the quantile still prunes as before for anyone who wants a smaller, more selective set of combinations.

**Files changed:** `signal-miner.html`

---

## [1.16.7] - 2026-08-15

### ETF Cloner ticker fix, Signal Miner live filters, mobile overflow hardening

Three fixes in one pass:

- **ETF Cloner share-class tickers now use Composer/Crescendo format.** Holdings feeds render multi-class tickers with a dot (`BRK.B`, `BF.B`) or dash (`BRK-B`), but Composer *and* Crescendo require the slash form `BRK/B` or the symphony will not save or backtest (community-reported and confirmed). `cleanSym()` now normalizes a trailing single-letter class suffix to `/X`, so both input paths (live fetch and file upload) and both the on-screen table and the emitted JSON use the compatible form. Plain tickers and multi-letter suffixes are left untouched; QA'd against `BRK.B`/`BRK-B`/`BF.B`/`LEN.B` (→ slash) and `VTI`/`VT`/`AAPL` (unchanged).

- **Signal Miner filters update results live, no re-run.** After a backtest, changing **Min Time in Market**, **Max Drawdown floor**, **Prune quantile**, or the **AND-pairing** toggle now re-filters the results instantly (debounced) instead of forcing a full re-run. The expensive Pass 1 caches every valid single-signal result plus the arrays needed for pairing; the filters re-apply against that cache and recompute only the cheap pairing step. Changing tickers, families, or the min period still needs a fresh run (those change which signals exist).

- **Mobile overflow hardening at ~390px.** Hardened `body` with `overflow-x: clip` and `overflow-wrap: break-word` so the page can no longer scroll sideways (which was clipping the nav/hamburger) and long tickers/IDs/URLs wrap instead of forcing width. `clip` does not make `<body>` a scroll container, so sticky/fixed positioning and the fixed nav are unaffected. Should still be eyeballed at ~390px on a device.

## [1.16.6] - 2026-08-15

### Renamed Signal Lab → Signal Miner; added a CPU-load throttle

**Rename:** "Signal Lab" is now **Signal Miner**: a name that describes what the tool actually does (brute-force mine a large combinatorial space of IF/THEN rules and backtest them). The page moved to `signal-miner.html` and the label updated across the nav Tools dropdown, footer, homepage Explore card, and page copy. The old `signal-lab.html` URL now serves a `noindex` redirect stub that forwards to the new URL (preserving any query string), so existing links keep working.

**CPU throttle:** Added a **CPU load** control (Easy on CPU / Balanced / Full speed, defaulting to Easy). "Easy" processes signals in smaller batches and idles briefly between them, so a big run no longer pins the processor at 100% and spins up fans; "Full speed" is the previous unthrottled behavior for anyone who wants maximum speed. This trades some wall-clock time for lower sustained CPU load and heat.

**Files changed:** `signal-miner.html` (renamed from `signal-lab.html`), `signal-lab.html` (new redirect stub), `js/app.js`, `index.html`, `docs/PRD.md`

---

## [1.16.5] - 2026-08-15

### Navigation: move About out of the primary nav

Removed **About** from the primary nav to trim the top level further; it remains in the footer sitemap (its complete-sitemap role is unchanged). Nav top level is now Home, Strategies, Database, Tools, Glossary, Azqato Invests, Support.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`

---

## [1.16.4] - 2026-08-15

### Signal Lab: no hard signal cap, warn-and-confirm instead; new default floors

Removed the hard 120k-signal stop that blocked large runs outright. A run above 100,000 signals now shows a confirm dialog explaining that the batch is large and may make the browser slow or unresponsive, and asks whether to proceed, the user can run it anyway or cancel. Also changed two defaults: **Min Time in Market** `0.025` → `0.05` and **Max Drawdown floor** `-0.5` → `-0.8` (both in the form and the example/reset preset). The live signal-count estimate still turns red past 100k as a heads-up, but no longer implies the run is blocked.

**Files changed:** `signal-lab.html`

---

## [1.16.3] - 2026-08-15

### Navigation: Tools dropdown; ETF Cloner added to footer + homepage

Reworked the primary nav to reduce top-level crowding: **RSI Signals**, **Signal Lab**, and **Converter** now live under a single **Tools** dropdown (hover or focus on desktop, click for touch/keyboard, with outside-click and Escape to close), leaving the top level as Home, Strategies, Database, Tools, Glossary, About, Azqato Invests, and Support. Added **ETF Cloner** to the footer sitemap and as a card in the homepage "Everything on this site" Explore grid; it remains intentionally out of the primary nav. This resolves the tracked footer-rule exception from 1.16.0, every public page is once again linked from the footer.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `css/main.css`, `index.html`

## [1.16.2] - 2026-08-15

### ETF Cloner: filter holdings to real companies; fully hide the file input

Issuer holdings files (and the live feed) list cash, futures, collateral, pending dividends, and currency as holding rows, and those line items can carry a "ticker" that collides with a real security, most notably a cash row of `USD` resolving to **USD**, the ProShares Ultra Semiconductors ETF. The tool now drops all such non-company rows, both by **name** (a cash/futures/collateral/dividend/currency blocklist) and by **currency-code ticker** (`USD`, `EUR`, `JPY`, …), on both the live-fetch and uploaded-file paths; the remaining company weights renormalize to 100%. Validated against the exact junk rows seen in a real QQQ file (all excluded) plus tricky real names that must be kept (FUTU Holdings, Forward Air, Option Care Health). Also hardened the dropzone's hidden file `<input>` (visually-hidden clip pattern) so the native picker control never paints on hover.

**Files changed:** `etf-cloner.html`

---

## [1.16.1] - 2026-08-15

### ETF Cloner: weighting toggle now governs uploaded baskets; required-columns note

Moved the **Match ETF weights / Equal weight** toggle out of the live-fetch panel and into the Holdings results panel, so a single control re-renders whatever result is shown (previously it read as disconnected when working from an uploaded file). Added a note to the upload panel that the imported file must contain a **Ticker** column and a **Weight** column (header labels like "Symbol" or "Weight (%)" are recognized; column order and extra columns do not matter).

**Files changed:** `etf-cloner.html`

---

## [1.16.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added ETF Cloner: turn any ETF into a Composer holdings-clone symphony

Added `etf-cloner.html`, a standalone tool that generates a Composer symphony replicating an ETF's holdings. Two independent, fully client-side input paths: (1) **type a ticker** to pull the fund's top ~25 holdings live (read from stockanalysis.com's `__data.json` route through a CORS relay, since issuer files and holdings APIs are otherwise CORS-blocked or key-gated), and (2) **upload the issuer's own holdings file** for the complete basket, CSV parsed directly, and `.xlsx` unzipped **natively in the browser** (`DecompressionStream('deflate-raw')` + `DOMParser`, no library), with a generic column-mapper that finds the Ticker/Weight/Name columns across issuer layouts. Either way it outputs a Composer symphony (`root` → `wt-cash-specified` to match fund weights, or `wt-cash-equal`) with copy-to-clipboard and download. Weights use a large denominator so hundreds of tiny full-basket positions never round to a zero weight; validated end to end against a real State Street SPY file (503 holdings, weights summing exactly). Nothing is uploaded anywhere and there is no server component.

The page is indexable but, at the user's request, is intentionally **not** linked from the primary nav, the footer sitemap, or the homepage Explore grid for now, the current tracked exception to the "footer links every public page" rule (see PRD Section 14, V2.2).

## [1.15.0] - 2026-08-15

> **Ordering note, added 2026-08-24.** This entry sits below `[1.16.0]` through `[1.16.4]` and above
> `[1.15.5]`, so it breaks the file's newest-first order in both directions. The 1.16.x block and the
> 1.15.x block were both released on 2026-08-15 and were written up out of sequence. **The version
> number and its position are both left as they are**, per the rule in PRD Section 22 that historical
> records are annotated rather than rewritten. Read the dates, not the position.

### Added Signal Lab: a client-side IF/THEN signal miner and backtester

Added `signal-lab.html`, a new standalone tool that brute-forces Composer-style "IF condition THEN invest in target" signals and backtests each one, reworked from scratch from a community Google Colab notebook by IAMCAPTAINNOW. It generates all five signal families (RSI vs level, RSI vs RSI, cumulative return vs level/return, return moving-average compare, return std-dev compare), plus 2-signal AND combinations with sequential quantile pruning, and ranks the survivors in a sortable, filterable table with a copy-as-Composer button per row. A selectable minimum signal period (default 10 days) filters the window grids, which span 10d to 200d.

Everything runs **entirely client-side in the browser** (in chunked passes with a progress bar so the UI never freezes); there is no server. The only input is `data/prices.json`, a committed snapshot of full daily adjusted-close history for a 37-ticker universe (the 20 Frontrunner RSI tickers plus common hedge, diversifier, and leveraged/inverse/volatility tickers, including GDXU and GDXD), fetched by the new `scripts/refresh_prices.py`. The backtest engine was validated to match an independent pandas reference to within 1e-6 on every metric.

The page is `noindex` and **not linked from navigation**, reached by direct URL only (same treatment as `converter.html`). The `prices.json` snapshot was shipped without automated refresh at first (scheduled the same day, see 1.15.1).

### Processed AddSymphony.csv: 2 new symphonies added

Added 2 new URLs from `data/AddSymphony.csv` to `data/database.json` directly, fetched real backtest data for each, and cleared the CSV back to its header. New entries: "Pals Minor Spell of Summon Money (Core Logic)" (`zY4jRnXoFC9e1Pt97YDS`), "PP MAX TEC" (`P7RLUTtWmTjkJBaNBQT9`). Database now has 6,667 entries.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/AddSymphony.csv`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

### Signal Lab "Copy" now exports a pasteable Composer symphony

Changed the Signal Lab results-table copy button from a plain-English string to **"Copy JSON"**, which puts a complete Composer symphony on the clipboard, ready to paste straight into the Composer editor. The output mirrors Composer's real export schema (`root` → `wt-cash-equal` → `if` → `if-child` then/else), with the target asset in the THEN branch and a cash proxy (BIL) in the ELSE branch, matching the tool's "hold cash when the signal is off" backtest. Each condition is emitted both as the modern `condition` object (a `compound` of `binary-compound` sub-conditions, with `ticker: "%"` + a `tickers` array, cumulative-return levels as whole-number percents, and `{ "constant": ... }` for fixed levels) and the legacy flat `lhs-fn`/`comparator`/`rhs-*` fields. AND-combined rows export as an "all of" compound; single signals as a one-condition compound. Node ids are freshly generated (`crypto.randomUUID` with a fallback). Validated field-for-field against a real Composer export.

## [1.15.4] - 2026-08-15

### Made the converter indexable

Removed the `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` tag from `converter.html`. Now that the converter has a footer link and a homepage Explore card, it should be discoverable in search like every other page. No page on the site carries a `noindex` meta anymore. The converter remains out of the primary nav by design.

**Files changed:** `converter.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.15.3] - 2026-08-15

### Formalized the navigation & linking model; footer is now a full sitemap

Codified a three-surface linking model (documented in PRD Section 10, "Navigation & Linking Model") and brought the site into line with it:

- **Footer = complete sitemap.** The footer now links *every* public-facing page. Added **Home** (and reordered so About sits at the end of the internal links). Only `404.html` is excluded.
- **Homepage "Everything on this site" grid = one card per self-built tool/section.** Added a **Converter** card (🔧), so the grid now covers all six internal footer tools (Strategies, Database, RSI, Signal Lab, Glossary, Converter). The grid moved from `.grid-5` to `.grid-3` (a balanced 3x2 for six cards; the unused `.grid-5` rule was removed), and the subhead changed from "Five ways to explore" to "Six ways to explore and build."
- **Primary nav = curated destinations.** Unchanged in this release; the converter stays out of the nav by design.

Net effect: the converter, previously footer-only, now also has a homepage Explore card (it remains `noindex` and out of the nav). Going forward, every new public page must be added to the footer; tools/sections also get an Explore card; only primary destinations go in the nav.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `index.html`, `css/main.css`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.15.2] - 2026-08-15

### Linked Signal Lab into navigation; added "Home" nav link

Promoted Signal Lab from a direct-URL-only tool to a first-class page: added it to the primary nav bar (between RSI and Glossary), the footer, and a new fifth homepage Explore card (with a 🧪 icon; the Explore grid moved from `.grid-4` to a new `.grid-5` layout, and the section copy changed from "Four ways" to "Five ways"). Removed its `noindex` meta so it can be indexed. The Symphony → JSON converter was given a footer link only (staying out of the nav and homepage, and keeping its `noindex`). Also added a "Home" link as the first item in the primary nav (previously only the logo and the mobile menu linked home); the mobile menu now derives from the same shared link list, so Home is no longer duplicated there.

Refreshed the homepage overview now that the site is fully built out: the hero blurb now mentions mining and backtesting your own signals, and the "How to use this site" section grew from three steps to four (adding a "Mine your own signals" step for Signal Lab, `.grid-3` to `.grid-4`, "Three steps" to "Four steps").

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `index.html`, `css/main.css`, `signal-lab.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.15.1] - 2026-08-15

### Scheduled weekly price refresh + last-refreshed display

Added `.github/workflows/refresh-prices.yml` to run `scripts/refresh_prices.py` automatically once a week (cron `7 8 * * 6`, 08:07 UTC every Saturday while markets are closed), committing any updated `data/prices.json` / `data/prices.js`. The script takes ~50 seconds to fetch all 37 tickers (a 1-second polite delay between API calls dominates); the full Action completes in roughly 75-90 seconds including checkout and Python setup. Also added a visible "Data last refreshed" indicator to the Signal Lab hero (with a green dot, the formatted `refreshed_at` date, ticker count, and latest covered trading day) and expanded the footer meta line to note the weekly cadence.

**Files changed:** `.github/workflows/refresh-prices.yml`, `signal-lab.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.16] - 2026-07-29

### Added Symphony → JSON converter tool

Added `converter.html`, a standalone tool that converts a Composer symphony (pasted URL or ID) into clean, formatted JSON and a readable IF/ELSE logic tree. It fetches from the Composer `/score` API with a CORS fallback (open-in-tab link), renders the full step tree including compound "Any of / All of" condition blocks, and offers copy/download plus an optional field-stripping toggle. Defaults to zoop's 2026 Frontrunner as the example on load. The page is `noindex` and **not linked from navigation**, reached by direct URL only.

**Files changed:** `converter.html`

---

## [1.14.15] - 2026-07-29

### Added Triple Accelerator to curated strategies library and full database

Added "Triple Accelerator" by Inverteum Capital (symphony ID `0jPwZ5Lm2Y3xH24oEijB`) to both `data/strategies.json` (curated library, now 30 entries) and `data/database.json` (full database, now 6,665 entries). The strategy is a compact three-state rotation: TQQQ RSI(10) > 79 routes to UVXY (overbought hedge), SPY above 200d MA routes to TQQQ (bull trend), and SPY below 200d MA routes to SPY (bear capital preservation). Stats: 75.4% ARR, 4,053x cumulative return over ~14.8 years, 61.7% max drawdown, 1.34 Sharpe, 1.22 Calmar. Tags: `rsi`, `leveraged-etfs`, `200d-ma`, `vix-tiers`.

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.14] - 2026-07-17

### Processed AddSymphony.csv: 10 new symphonies added and refreshed

Added 10 new URLs from `data/AddSymphony.csv` to `data/storage.csv` and `data/database.json` directly (per the established narrow workflow), refreshed all 10 with real backtest data, regenerated the summary export, cleared the CSV back to its header. New entries: Some Dip Buys, TECL Dip, BSC REMOVED | Single Popped, Safe Dips/Rips l 10 Jan 2011, Hi-Volume DipRip, Basic RSI OB/OS Framework, High Win Rate Test V2, FR 11/14/2025 Front Runner Current | NOVA'd | Interstellar RL, When QQQ is cheap AND world is ending buy TQQQ and some UVXY also, Nested BTD (YINN/YANG surgically removed).

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/storage.csv`, `data/AddSymphony.csv`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.13] - 2026-07-17

### Processed AddSymphony.csv: 3 new symphonies added and refreshed

Added 3 new URLs from `data/AddSymphony.csv` to `data/storage.csv` and `data/database.json` directly (per the established narrow workflow), refreshed all 3 with real backtest data, regenerated the summary export, cleared the CSV back to its header. New entries: "L/S" (`d2IT6JJmlGr1YqtiLfz3`), "BIL+ (2x, No BTC)" (`oUF7srtPrrr5X7ipcCXM`), "BSC" (`GojyU2D4nF50GI33A7za`).

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/storage.csv`, `data/AddSymphony.csv`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.12] - 2026-07-15

### Confirmed the full 2026-Edition replacement mapping; added zoop's KMLM Switcher

User confirmed the SPXL/UPRO ticker-swap mapping, submitted the KMLM Switcher replacement (added to `data/database.json` and refreshed with real backtest data: +231.7% ARR, 2.36 Sharpe), and decided Manhattan Project should be removed outright rather than replaced. Full 12-strategy mapping (11 replacements + 1 removal) now locked in the Section 14 roadmap entry, ready to apply to the curated set whenever that work is picked up.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/storage.csv`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.11] - 2026-07-15

### Added 10 new symphonies via AddSymphony.csv; mapped to curated 2026-Edition replacements

Processed `data/AddSymphony.csv` per the documented workflow: added the 10 new URLs to `data/storage.csv` and `data/database.json` directly (explicitly *not* via `scripts/sync_storage_to_database.py`, per the storage.csv-divergence warning added this session), refreshed each with real backtest data, regenerated the summary export, cleared the CSV back to its header.

Also documented two operational incidents from this session for future reference: (1) `sync_storage_to_database.py` pulled in 1,055 stale/purged entries instead of 10 when first tried, reverted before committing, redone by adding rows directly; (2) a background `refresh_full_database.py` run (legitimately processing the full ~6,600-row backlog, not stuck) was mistaken for a batch of zombie processes and killed via `taskkill /F /IM python.exe`: lost ~7 rows of uncheckpointed progress (harmless, picked up on a future run) but was a real mistake worth a permanent note against blind process cleanup in this environment.

Once refreshed, the 10 new symphonies' real names revealed a clear mapping to 9 of the 12 curated "zoop's X (2026 Edition)" strategies (documented in Section 14, V2.2): logged as the next roadmap item, not yet applied to `data/strategies.json`. Two open questions flagged: one probable match (SPXL vs. UPRO ticker swap) needs confirmation, and two curated strategies (Manhattan Project, KMLM Switcher) have no submitted replacement yet.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/storage.csv`, `data/AddSymphony.csv`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.14.10] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed orphaned duplicate pointers; 8 more clusters swapped to most-watched member

Fixed a bug from the previous "Holy Grail" override: 3 other cluster members still referenced the old (now itself flagged) kept ID instead of the new one. A one-off headless-Chrome scrape sampled 13 duplicate clusters' "Watched by N" counts (not exposed by the API) and found the current `symphony_id`-based tiebreak had picked the most-watched member in only 2 of 13, swapped the other 8 correctly-mismatched clusters to their most-watched member, updating every cluster member's pointer consistently this time (not just the swapped pair): Mean Reversion Comparison to Python Code, TQQQ FTLT w/Sideways Market Mods (FINAL), Nuclear Energy with Feaver Frontrunner V5, S&P Symphony w/ Leverage, TQQQ or Not - Non-Degen Gambler Variant, "We know this works. We just get greedy.", Inside Nancy Pelosi's Chips- V3, Copy of Holy Grail simplified.

---

## [1.14.9] - 2026-07-15

### Manual duplicate override: "The Holy Grail" restored as the kept entry

The dedup pipeline's deterministic tiebreak (earliest `symphony_id` when `oos_date` ties) had picked "The Holy Grail (Buy Copy)" over the plain-named "The Holy Grail" as the canonical kept row within a 5-member identical cluster, correct per the documented policy, but not what the user wanted for this specific strategy. Manually swapped which of the two carries `flag: null` vs. `flag: "duplicate"` directly in `data/database.json`, regenerated `data/database.js` and `data/database_summary.json`/`.js`. Also logged a future-state idea to the roadmap: eventually basing the dedup tiebreak on a symphony's "Watched by N" popularity count instead of `symphony_id`: not buildable yet, that count isn't exposed by the API endpoints this pipeline uses.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.8] - 2026-07-15

### Added data/AddSymphony.csv: a manual symphony-submission inbox

New single-column CSV (`url`), same format as `storage.csv`, where the user drops new Composer symphony URLs to submit for database inclusion. Documented the full workflow in `docs/PRD.md`'s Operational Runbook: check each URL against `storage.csv` for duplicates, append survivors to `storage.csv`, add them to `database.json` as new unrefreshed rows, refresh and regenerate the summary export, then clear the file back to its header. Manual-only by design, same posture as `flag_name_noise.py`/`dedupe_symphonies.py`: never runs automatically or from a scheduled workflow.

**Files changed:** `data/AddSymphony.csv` (new), `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.7] - 2026-07-15

### Redesigned the homepage stats bar; trimmed ~331KB of dead page weight

Replaced the original 5 homepage stats (Best Sharpe/Top ARR were cherry-picked maximums from the curated 29) with 5 chosen for honesty and site-wide scope after rating ~30 candidate stats for homepage importance: **6,640 Strategies** (full database), **+48.7% Median ARR** (full-DB median), **-34.7% Median Drawdown** (full-DB median), **29 Curated**, **Last Refreshed** (Jul 12, 2026). Currently hardcoded static values, to be replaced later by a small derived stats file rather than loading the full `database_summary.json` client-side (would blow the homepage's own <500KB page-weight target). Also removed `data/strategies.js`/`data/glossary.js` from `index.html`: dead weight (~331KB combined) now that the homepage no longer computes stats or renders strategies client-side.

**Files changed:** `index.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.6] - 2026-07-15

### Roadmap: Leaderboard Ranking coming to the Screener (V2.2, next up)

Documentation only, nothing built yet. Decided to surface the V1.17 Leaderboard score/tier inside the Screener both as a bucket-filter select (Tier: S+/S/A/B/C/F, matching the existing dropdown pattern) and as a sortable Rank/Score/Tier column added to all three Screener views (Overview, Risk-Adjusted, Distribution), reusing the existing `computeScores()`/`computeTiers()` logic against the Screener's already-filtered pool.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.5] - 2026-07-15

### Redesigned the homepage as a marketing/landing page

`index.html` no longer renders the strategy grid inline (all 29 cards): that's `strategies.html`'s job now, and it already has its own listing sorted the same way. New homepage structure: rewritten hero copy framing the whole site (not just curated strategies), the existing stats bar unchanged, a new 4-card "Explore the Site" grid (Strategies / Database / RSI Signals / Glossary), and a new 3-step "How to use this site" section. Modeled structurally after a landing page built for a sibling project, adapted to this site's own design tokens. New CSS: `.grid-4`, `.explore-icon`, `.step-num`.

**Files changed:** `index.html`, `css/main.css`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.4] - 2026-07-15

### Nav reorder, strategies.html sort/copy, homepage hero link fix

Reordered the top nav to Strategies, Database, RSI, Glossary, About, Azqato Invests, Support (`js/app.js`, desktop + mobile). `strategies.html`'s listing now sorts by longest backtest first, matching the homepage grid exactly, and its intro copy now explains these are "merely a set of featured, highlighted strategies" with a link to the full Database for anyone wanting more. The homepage's "Browse Strategies" button previously jumped to an in-page `#strategies` anchor; now links to `strategies.html`, same `u()`-based pattern already used for the Glossary button. Also added a Roadmap item (V2.2) for a pre-existing mobile overflow bug at ~390px width, found while testing `strategies.html` and confirmed sitewide via `about.html`: not yet fixed, needs root-cause investigation.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `strategies.html`, `index.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.3] - 2026-07-15

### Screener refinements: search box, dropped flag toggle, denser bucket options

`database.html`: added a "Search by name..." textbox to the left of the Filter button on All Strategies and Leaderboard (Screener already had one); all three name-search boxes (including Screener's pre-existing one) now filter live on every keystroke instead of requiring Enter/blur, with focus/cursor position preserved across the re-render. Removed Screener's 3-state flag toggle (Default/All/Broken) entirely, Screener is now always Working-only, matching Leaderboard's existing non-toggleable behavior; only All Strategies keeps a toggle. Screener's bucket dropdowns expanded from 4-5 sparse percentile options to a uniform 9 deciles (10th-90th, 10% steps) + Any = 10 options per field, for all 20 fields.

Also corrected a stale "28 curated strategies" count to 29 in two spots in `docs/PRD.md` and in `README.md` (library grew to 29 in a prior update), and removed README's now-outdated note that the Leaderboard scoring model was "due for a revision" (V1.17 shipped it 2026-07-13).

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `css/main.css`, `docs/PRD.md`, `README.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.2] - 2026-07-15

### Added AI Summaries for 4 strategies; documented required add-strategy step

Added `ai_summary` content for the 4 strategies that were missing it: `bnd-vs-sphb`, `dip-buying-tech`, `ob-os-staple-bonds`, and `sometimes-tqqq`. All 29 strategies now have AI Summaries.

Updated `scripts/add_ai_summary.py` with entries for all 4 new slugs. Ran the script to write summaries into `data/strategies.json` and `data/strategies.js`.

Updated `docs/PRD.md` to make adding a slug to `scripts/add_ai_summary.py` an explicit required step in both the manual and automated add-strategy workflows. The script is the canonical store for all summaries; writing `ai_summary` directly in the JSON without also updating the script means the entry is not tracked in the canonical location and will produce a warning on future script runs.

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `scripts/add_ai_summary.py`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.1] - 2026-07-13

### Tightened S+ tier from top 1% to top 0.25%

Launch feedback: top 1% (62/6,225 eligible entries) produced too many S+ strategies. Tightened to top 0.25%, now 16 entries. S's band absorbs the difference (9.75% instead of 9%, keeping S+ combined with S at the same top-10% boundary); A/B/C/F unchanged.

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-13

### Shipped V1.17: Leaderboard scoring model revision

Reweighted all 20 existing metrics against the site's actual mission (best return + long backtest + relatively safe) instead of the original category-based point split, raised the clamp constant from 0.22 to 0.14 so top performers separate more, and redefined S+ from an unreachable "literal perfect score" into a real top-1% rank cut (confirmed live: 62 of 6,225 eligible entries now land in S+). Category display collapsed from 7 to 4 (Return / Risk-Adjusted+Downside Risk / Shape & Concentration / Longevity) in the breakdown and Methodology modals. No metrics were dropped; nothing changed about eligibility or the noise-exclusion rule. Full rationale, every metric's weight, and the clamp-constant testing that led to 0.14 are documented in `docs/PRD.md` Section 14, V1.17.

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.13.8] - 2026-07-13

### Roadmap: planned cross-links between curated strategies and the full database (V2.2)

Documentation only, nothing implemented. Confirmed all 29 curated strategies already exist as rows in the full database (matched by `symphony_id`), and that both pipelines redundantly backtest the same 29 symphonies via identical Composer API calls on separate schedules. Decided to add navigational cross-links only (a "View in full database" link from strategy detail pages, a "★ Curated" badge on matching `database.html` rows) rather than merging the two metrics pipelines into one source of truth, that bigger option was considered and explicitly deferred (not rejected) pending a real decision on flagged-row fallback behavior, since it introduces a coupling risk the cross-link-only approach doesn't. Full writeup added under V2.2 in Section 14.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.13.7] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed: formatDate() off-by-one day in timezones behind UTC

The database Last-Updated badge showed "Jul 11, 2026" when the underlying `refresh_date` was actually `2026-07-12`. Root cause: `formatDate()` in `js/app.js` built a `Date` at UTC midnight (`iso + 'T00:00:00Z'`) but called `.toLocaleDateString()` without a `timeZone` option, so the browser rendered it in the viewer's local timezone, any timezone behind UTC (all of the Americas) shows the previous calendar day. Fixed by adding `timeZone: 'UTC'` to the formatting options. This is a shared helper used everywhere a date-only field is displayed (strategy detail pages' "Last Updated" row, the database badge, etc.), so the fix corrects all of them, not just the one badge that surfaced it.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.13.6] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed: RSI workflow silently never fired on its first weekday test

Data was last refreshed Friday 2026-07-10 23:06 UTC, all 3 of Friday's slots ran fine, but Monday's (2026-07-13) 15:00 UTC slot, the schedule's first real weekday test, never fired at all (confirmed via the GitHub Actions API: 0 runs since Friday, while sibling scheduled workflows in this repo fired normally in the same window). Root cause: `refresh-rsi.yml`'s cron was `0 15,19,22 * * 1-5`, on-the-hour, GitHub Actions' most congested scheduling slot, prone to being delayed for hours or dropped on public repos. The two sibling workflows (`refresh-full-database.yml`, `update-metrics.yml`) already avoid this by offsetting their cron minute (`:07`, `:20` respectively); `refresh-rsi.yml` was the one workflow that didn't get the same treatment when it was written. Fixed by changing to `7 15,19,22 * * 1-5`.

**Files changed:** `.github/workflows/refresh-rsi.yml`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.13.5] - 2026-07-13

### Replaced "work in progress" text with a Last-Updated badge

`database.html`'s "This section is a work in progress." line is gone, replaced with a pill badge (green dot + "Last database update: [date]") computed client-side as the max `refresh_date` across all loaded entries, same visual pattern as an equivalent badge on a sibling site. `rsi.html`'s existing "Last refreshed" line was restyled to match the same `.updated-badge` component instead of being plain text. Also dropped the stale "(in progress)" from `database.html`'s meta description.

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `rsi.html`, `css/main.css`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.13.4] - 2026-07-13

### Added: Sometimes TQQQ (Original): 29 strategies total

- **Sometimes TQQQ (Original)** (`sometimes-tqqq`, symphony `MyRyWhvbdxTsRfzHmE1U`): Five-regime TQQQ framework. Two unconditional priority gates: QQQ RSI(10) < 32 rotates to TECL (3x tech dip-buy); SPY RSI(10) < 30 rotates to UPRO (3x S&P500 dip-buy). Overbought guards: QQQ RSI(10) > 81 or SPY RSI(10) > 80 rotates to UVXY. Bull market routes through three sub-strategies (Choppy Market, Bull 1, Bull 2) using SPY 60d RSI and TLT vs. PSQ momentum; bear market through two (Bear 1 deep, Bear 2 shallow). Bond vs. equity momentum comparisons (BND vs. BIL, IEF vs. PSQ, BND vs. SH) determine TQQQ vs. PSQ/SQQQ/GLD/BIL at each sub-strategy. ARR 326.5%, max DD 45.6%, Sharpe 2.76, Calmar 7.17, ~14.7-year backtest from ~October 2011 (UVXY launch). Authored by Guybogles (Discord: aly9923). Tags: `rsi`, `leveraged-etfs`, `inverse-etfs`, `200d-ma`, `vix-tiers`, `mean-reversion`.

## [1.13.3] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed: RSI signal colors never actually rendered (CSS specificity bug)

The `.rsi-*` classes added in v1.13.2 were bare single-class selectors (`.rsi-oversold { color: ... }`), which lost the cascade to `.db-table td`'s own `color` rule, a class+type selector (specificity 0,1,1) beats a single class (0,1,0) regardless of source order. Every row on `rsi.html` rendered in the default table text color; the entire signal color-coding feature silently never worked. Caught by building a temporary all-five-tiers test page to visually confirm each color. Fixed by rescoping every rule to `.db-table td.rsi-x`. Also brightened the two inner tiers (`#890000`→`#e04545`, `#008900`→`#2fb92f`) for legibility against the dark table background; both extremes (`#ff0000`/`#00ff00`) unchanged.

**Files changed:** `css/main.css`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`

## [1.13.2] - 2026-07-09

### Custom RSI signal color palette (user-specified, not the standard tokens)

Per explicit user direction, replaced the RSI signal tier colors with a literal green (oversold)→red (overbought) gradient instead of reusing `--color-green`/`--color-yellow`/`--color-pink`: `.rsi-extreme-overbought` `#00ff00` bold, `.rsi-overbought` `#008900`, `.rsi-neutral` `#b0b0b0`, `.rsi-oversold` `#890000`, `.rsi-extreme-oversold` `#ff0000` bold. No opacity tricks; both extreme tiers bold, inner three are not. Documented as a deliberate token exception in `docs/DESIGN.md` (bumped to v1.6) since it inverts the site's usual green-good/pink-bad convention specifically for this page.

**Files changed:** `css/main.css`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.13.1] - 2026-07-09

### Retuned RSI signal thresholds

The 70/30 thresholds shipped in v1.13.0 rendered every one of the 20 tickers as "Neutral" on launch day (all landed between 34.7 and 65.2 RSI), making the page look inert on a typical day. Retuned to: ≥79 Extreme Overbought, 70–78 Overbought, 42–69 Neutral, 29–41 Oversold, ≤28 Extreme Oversold. No new color tokens, still reuses `--color-green`/`--color-yellow`/`--color-pink`.

**Files changed:** `rsi.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-09

### Shipped V2.1: Live RSI Signals Page

New `rsi.html` page showing live 10-day RSI (Wilder's smoothing) for the 20-ticker Frontrunner signal universe. `scripts/refresh_rsi.py` fetches Yahoo Finance daily adjusted closes and writes `data/rsi.json`/`.js`; a new `.github/workflows/refresh-rsi.yml` runs it automatically 3x/day on weekdays (`0 15,19,22 * * 1-5`). Table is sortable by Ticker/RSI, defaults to descending RSI, and color-codes each row into five signal tiers (Extreme Oversold → Extreme Overbought) using the existing `--color-green`/`--color-yellow`/`--color-pink` tokens rather than introducing a new color. Added "RSI" to the top nav (desktop + mobile) after "Database". Built ahead of its numbered slot per explicit user request (2026-07-08/09), same pattern as V1.16.

**Files changed:** `rsi.html` (new), `scripts/refresh_rsi.py` (new), `data/rsi.json`/`.js` (new), `.github/workflows/refresh-rsi.yml` (new), `js/app.js`, `css/main.css`, `README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`

---

## [1.12.4] - 2026-07-09

### Renumbered roadmap now that V2.0 has shipped

Since V2.0 (Full Database Goes Public) is complete, renumbered the remaining V2.x backlog to read sequentially from the next version forward: the Live RSI Signals Page is now **V2.1** (still built next, ahead of V1.17), Scale + Discovery moves to **V2.2**, and Community Signals moves to **V2.3**. No scope or priority changes, only version labels and cross-references. Documentation only.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.12.3] - 2026-07-08

### Prioritized V2.3 (Live RSI Signals Page) ahead of its numbered slot

Per user request, V2.3 (fully speced in a prior session, before this thread, locked ticker list, RSI formula/methodology, data source, page design, nav placement, refresh cadence) moves to the front of the build queue, ahead of V1.17 (Leaderboard scoring revision) and V2.1/V2.2. Same pattern as V1.16 being built ahead of its numbered slot. Cross-referenced the reprioritization on both V2.3's and V1.17's status lines. Documentation only, implementation not yet started.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.12.2] - 2026-07-08

### Roadmap cleanup: closed stale V1.14/V1.15 checklist items

Found while reviewing "next steps", a few checklist items were left unchecked from before V1.14/V1.15 were actually completed. Marked Part A (name-based noise) done, marked V1.15's status Complete (was still "In Progress"), closed out the Leaderboard/Screener/Filter Panel re-verification item (covered by all the live CDP testing done throughout V1.14), and closed the recovery-rate item with the final counts rather than a separately-tracked metric that was never actually built. Documentation only, no code changes.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.12.1] - 2026-07-08

### Added "Azqato Invests" to the nav

New nav link, `https://azqato.com/invests`, positioned before "Support" in both desktop and mobile nav (both derive from the same `links` array in `js/app.js`, so one change covers both). Verified live via the CDP harness: correct position on desktop, correct position in the mobile drawer, and no regression of the mobile horizontal-overflow fix from the previous entry.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.12.0] - 2026-07-08

### V2.0: Full Database goes live

`data/database.json`/`.js`, `data/database_summary.json`/`.js`, and `data/storage.csv` are committed and public for the first time, the code has been live on `database.html` since v1.11.2, but the data files were deliberately withheld until the full refresh and V1.14 noise-filtering pass completed. Final numbers at go-live: 6,640 total entries, 6,221 clean, 229 `duplicate`, 88 `excluded`, 88 `caution`, 14 `retry`.

**Pre-launch mobile audit found and fixed two real, pre-existing sitewide CSS bugs**, not specific to this page or introduced this session: (1) `.nav-cta` (the "Open Composer" nav button) had equal CSS specificity to `.btn`'s `display: inline-flex` and lost the cascade regardless of viewport, the button never actually hid on mobile, anywhere on the site. Fixed by reordering `.nav-cta`'s rule after `.btn`'s. (2) `.db-tabs` (page tabs, Screener's view switcher, the flag-mode toggle) had no `overflow-x`, so on narrow viewports its content forced the whole page to scroll horizontally instead of scrolling internally. Fixed with `overflow-x: auto`. Also fixed a `database.html`-specific version of the same underlying problem: `.page` (a `flex: 1` child of `body { display: flex }`) had no `min-width: 0`, letting its widest descendant (the data table) force the whole page wider than the viewport instead of `.db-table-wrap`'s own `overflow-x: auto` containing it. Verified via headless-Chrome screenshots at a 390px mobile viewport before and after each fix, first attempt at verification gave false readings due to a mistake in the CDP test harness (`mobile: true` in `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` was reporting an incorrect `window.innerWidth`), caught and corrected before trusting the results.

**Added `.github/workflows/refresh-full-database.yml`**: automates `scripts/refresh_full_database.py` weekly (Sunday 01:07 UTC), plus regenerates `database_summary.json`/`.js` so the live site's actual data source stays in sync. `STALE_AFTER_DAYS` (7) matches this weekly cadence exactly, so essentially the entire database is "due" every run (~4.5-5 hours at the proven-safe throttle): unlike `update-metrics.yml`'s near-no-op daily runs over 25 strategies. Designed around a mid-run timeout: the refresh step has its own 340-minute cap with `continue-on-error: true`, and the summary-regen/commit steps run with `if: always()`, so a cut-short run still commits whatever was checkpointed rather than losing it. Confirmed with the user this is scoped to `refresh_full_database.py` only, `flag_name_noise.py`/`dedupe_symphonies.py` remain explicitly manual-only, not wired into this or any workflow.

**Updated `README.md`** and Section 6's Feature List (`docs/PRD.md`) to describe the Full Database section as live rather than "in progress, not fully public."

**Files changed:** `data/database.json` (new), `data/database.js` (new), `data/database_summary.json` (new), `data/database_summary.js` (new), `data/storage.csv` (new), `data/Full Database.xlsx` (new), `.github/workflows/refresh-full-database.yml` (new), `css/main.css`, `README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.23] - 2026-07-08

### V1.14 complete: dedup pipeline finished its full run

`scripts/dedupe_symphonies.py` (launched in the previous entry) finished processing all 362 candidate clusters (842 candidate rows): **225 rows flagged `duplicate`** this run (229 total including the earlier validation test), **23 logic-tree fetches failed** (mostly `404`s, likely symphonies deleted/made private since being scraped, left ungrouped rather than force-refreshed, a known gap, not a crash). Regenerated `database_summary.json`/`.js` and `Full Database.xlsx` to match.

**Confirmed the sequencing worked as designed** on the real "Holy Grail simplified" cluster used throughout this whole thread as the running example: `flag_name_noise.py` (run first) had already flagged `TESTPORT #016:...` as `excluded`, so by the time dedup ran it was never a candidate, the `symphony_id` tiebreak picked a legitimately-named row among the remaining three instead. Updated the PRD's documented example to reflect this real outcome rather than the earlier prediction.

Final database-wide `flag` tally: 6,221 clean, 229 duplicate, 88 excluded, 88 caution, 14 retry (6,640 total entries). Marked V1.14 (both Part A and Part B) as **Implemented** in the roadmap.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/Full Database.xlsx`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.22] - 2026-07-08

### V1.14 Part A implemented: name-noise flagging + logic-tree dedup pipeline, plus a manual-only rule

Built out the full V1.14 Part A pipeline designed over the previous several entries:

**`scripts/flag_name_noise.py`** (new): flags `TESTPORT #`/`[Work]`/`STILL BUILDING` rows with `flag = "excluded"` (reusing the existing level, no new UI surface needed), no API calls. Run: flagged 88 rows.

**`scripts/dedupe_symphonies.py`** (new): implements the full dedup policy from the last several entries, normalize-name clustering (candidate-finding only), logic-tree structural equality as the primary identity check (one `GET /symphonies/{id}/score` call per candidate row), metrics-tolerance fallback, `oos_date`→`symphony_id` tiebreak with no name-based priority, flags losers `flag = "duplicate"` without deleting anything. Tested against a real 5-member "Holy Grail" family before the full run (correctly kept the row matching the hand-computed tiebreak, correctly left two near-miss rows alone since their names didn't normalize into the same candidate cluster, an accepted soft-miss, not a bug). Full run launched against all 362 candidate clusters (842 rows); in progress as of this entry.

Also purged the remaining 41 `excluded` (404/422) rows via the existing `scripts/purge_flagged_entries.py`.

**Documented a manual-only rule**, per user request: neither script (nor any other full-database maintenance script) should ever be added to a GitHub Actions workflow or other CI/scheduled job. `dedupe_symphonies.py` makes hundreds of live API calls per run and can take 20-30+ minutes; running it unattended risks hammering Composer's API far more than a human would choose to. Added explicit warnings to both scripts' docstrings and a new Operational Runbook section ("Name-Based Noise & De-Duplication").

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/Full Database.xlsx`, `scripts/flag_name_noise.py` (new), `scripts/dedupe_symphonies.py` (new), `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.21] - 2026-07-08

### Replaced All Strategies' "Last Updated" column with "OOS"

Per user decision, no reason to show users how stale a row's `refresh_date` is. Swapped the column for `oos_date` (days since the strategy's logic was last edited), reusing the existing `formatOosDays()`/`isDuration` rendering path already built for the Screener's bucket filters, no new formatting logic needed. Verified via the CDP harness: header reads "OOS", cells render as e.g. "114d"/"163d" instead of a calendar date.

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.20] - 2026-07-08

### Added a "Duplicates" flag-mode placeholder to All Strategies/Screener

Per user decision, added `"Duplicates"` as a 4th flag-mode toggle option on both All Strategies and Screener, positioned between "Broken" and "All" (full order: Working, Broken, Duplicates, All). Filters to `flag === 'duplicate'` specifically, distinct from "Broken" (`caution`/`excluded`). "Working" (the default view) now also excludes `duplicate`-flagged rows via a shared `isNoiseFlag()` check covering all three noise categories.

This is a placeholder: no row in the database currently has `flag: "duplicate"`: the V1.14 Part A dedup pipeline that would set it (logic-tree structural comparison, tiebreak, flagging) is fully designed (see the last several PATCHNOTES entries) but not yet built. "Duplicates" correctly shows 0 results until that pipeline runs. Verified via the same headless-Chrome CDP harness used for the original flag-mode work: toggle order/labels correct, "Duplicates" mode returns 0 as expected.

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.19] - 2026-07-08

### All Strategies page copy/layout tweaks: description text, toolbar layout, flag-mode relabel

Small batch of UI tweaks, not previously versioned:

- **Page description** shortened and split into two paragraphs: "A community-sourced database of thousands of Composer.trade symphonies, not just the 25 curated strategies." / "This section is a work in progress." (dropped "gathered from many locations").
- **All Strategies toolbar**: removed the "N with usable metrics" secondary text; the Filter button now sits in that spot instead (right side of the toolbar).
- **Flag-mode toggle relabeled and reordered**: "Default" → "Working"; order changed from Working/All/Broken to Working/Broken/All. Applies to both All Strategies and Screener automatically, since both share the same `flagToggleHtml()`/`FLAG_MODES` code.

**Files changed:** `database.html`

---

## [1.11.18] - 2026-07-08

### V1.14 Part A dedup: tiebreak confirmed as-is, candidate-finding elaborated, losers now flagged instead of deleted (documentation only, nothing implemented)

Three follow-ups resolved from the previous entry, all documentation:

**Tiebreak confirmed with no name-based priority.** Per user decision, `symphony_id` sort is used exactly as specified even when it produces a counterintuitive keeper, no special-casing for `TESTPORT #`/WIP-marker names. Demonstrated with two more real clusters: the 4-way "Holy Grail simplified" cluster (already-known example, full walkthrough of the ID sort); and a 6-row "TQQQ For The Long Term V2 (226.7% RR/46.1% Max DD)" cluster that splits into two identical sub-groups (one where `oos_date` differs and the primary rule decides directly, one where it ties and falls to the ID sort) plus one genuine remix correctly excluded from both.

**Candidate-finding elaborated:** name-normalization alone, no corroborating signal (e.g. holdings matching) needed, reasoned through why the two possible failure modes of the name filter are asymmetric (false positives are harmless since the structural check catches them; false negatives are just a soft "didn't dedupe as aggressively as possible," never a wrong deletion). Flagged that the normalization regex needs `(Buy Copy)` added, currently missing alongside `(Invest Copy)`.

**Disposition changed:** duplicates are now flagged, not deleted, a real policy reversal from the v1.11.16 "delete outright" plan, specific to dedup (the already-executed 404/422 `excluded` purge from v1.11.14 is unaffected). New `flag` value `"duplicate"` proposed for all cluster losers. UI: proposed an independent toggle from the existing Default/All/Broken control, not folded into "Broken," per user request that it be filterable, not yet confirmed/built.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.17] - 2026-07-08

### V1.14 Part A dedup: logic-tree structural comparison adopted as the primary identity check (documentation only, nothing implemented)

Follow-up to v1.11.16's metrics-tolerance dedup policy. Investigated whether symphony structure could be compared directly instead of inferring duplication from backtest metrics, it can, via `GET /api/v0.1/symphonies/{id}/score?score_version=v1` (already documented in Section 13, Logic Tree Endpoint), a single lightweight GET per symphony that returns the full IF/ELSE logic tree, no backtest execution required.

**Tested live against the real 4-row "Holy Grail simplified" cluster** from the previous entry: raw responses differ in size/hash (Composer assigns a unique UUID to every node, even on literal clones), but after stripping every `id` field (root and nested) and the root `name` field, all four rows hash **byte-for-byte identical**: confirming they're genuinely the same underlying strategy logic, not just similar-performing.

**Revised the policy** to make this the primary identity check, with the earlier metrics-tolerance approach (3 percentage points absolute / 3% relative, same-`refresh_date`-only) demoted to a fallback for when the logic-tree endpoint is unavailable. The structural check needs no tolerance threshold (exact match, not "close enough") and no same-day-refresh alignment, since logic tree structure doesn't drift day to day the way backtest metrics do.

**Still open, not yet decided:** whether name-normalization alone is a strong enough signal for finding dedup *candidates* in the first place (before spending an API call on the structural check); the TESTPORT/WIP-marker-vs-tiebreak-priority question from the previous entry, still unresolved; and the disposition of the standalone name-pattern noise rules (TESTPORT #, WIP markers) independent of dedup.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.11.16] - 2026-07-08

### V1.14 Part A: de-duplication policy decided (documentation only, nothing implemented)

Planning session for the near-identical-name-cluster de-duplication policy, no code, no data changes, per user request to document the discussion before implementing.

**Decided:** cluster rows by normalized name (strip `TESTPORT #N:`/`Copy of`/`(Invest Copy)` patterns); within a cluster, only compare metrics between rows refreshed on the *same day* (force a refresh first if not), on a fixed field subset (`annualized_rate_of_return`, `max_drawdown`, `trailing_one_year_return`, `cumulative_return`, `sharpe_ratio`, `calmar_ratio`, `backtest_days`); rows differing on any of those are genuine remixes and all stay; identical rows keep the longest `oos_date`, tiebreaking on lexicographically-earliest `symphony_id`; losers get deleted outright (URL preserved in `storage.csv` first, reusing the `purge_flagged_entries.py` safety-invariant pattern), not just flagged.

**Found and presented a real example** from the live data: a 4-way "Holy Grail simplified" cluster, all refreshed the same day, all target metrics *and* `oos_date` identical, a full tie that falls through to the `symphony_id` tiebreak, which lands on the `TESTPORT #016:`-prefixed row. Surfaced a real conflict this exposes: `TESTPORT #` is supposed to be its own separate noise pattern (excluded outright), so it probably shouldn't be eligible to "win" a dedup tiebreak, likely resolution is pattern-based exclusion running before/taking priority over the dedup tiebreak, but this isn't finalized yet.

**Still open, not yet decided:** whether name-normalization alone is a reliable-enough clustering signal or needs corroboration (e.g. matching `last_market_days_holdings`); the TESTPORT-vs-tiebreak priority question above; and the disposition (delete vs. flag) of the other Part A noise patterns (`TESTPORT #`, WIP markers) independent of dedup.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.11.15] - 2026-07-08

### V1.14 Part B UI: flag-based exclusion on All Strategies/Screener/Leaderboard; Screener redesigned as a Finviz-style bucketed filter grid

**Flag-based exclusion**, per user decisions: All Strategies and Screener each get an independent 3-state toggle, **Default** (excludes `caution`/`excluded` rows), **All** (shows everything), **Broken** (shows only flagged rows). Leaderboard is *not* toggleable, it always excludes flagged rows from its scoring pool and recomputes percentile ranks/tiers accordingly, since unlike the other two tabs this can't be a simple post-hoc render filter. `retry` (transient 429/500/503/timeout) is deliberately never treated as noise, those rows behave normally and clear on their own via the next refresh.

**Screener redesigned**: replaced the hidden, click-to-open Filter Panel (previously shared with All Strategies) with an always-visible, Finviz-style grid of one label+dropdown per field (20 fields, plus a free-text name search), per a reference screenshot the user provided. All Strategies is unchanged and keeps its existing specific-value Filter Panel, the two tabs now intentionally have different filter UIs, not a shared component. Bucket thresholds (25th/50th/75th/90th percentile per field) are computed live from the loaded dataset rather than hardcoded, so they don't go stale as the database changes. `backtest_days`/`oos_date` use natural-language duration labels ("Over 3.5 years") instead of raw day counts, per user request. The "Broken" toggle label itself was also a direct rename from an initial "Flagged Only" per user request.

**Testing:** no `chromium-cli` or Playwright available in this environment, so verification was done by driving headless Chrome directly over its DevTools Protocol remote-debugging websocket (custom Python harness, not saved as a project asset). Confirmed: All Strategies mode counts correct across all three states; Leaderboard has zero flag-toggle UI; Screener bucket selects render with live percentile-derived options and correctly filter results (e.g. "ARR: Over 50%" cut 6,549 → 3,268); zero console errors throughout. One false alarm caught and resolved: the bucket grid initially screenshotted as a single stacked column, root cause was stale browser cache serving pre-edit CSS, not a real layout bug, confirmed once cache was disabled for the test session.

Also folded in the results of the 845-row background refresh (entries with a null `oos_date`) that completed during this work: 790 OK, 55 failed (transient), current flag distribution 6,538 clean / 88 caution / 41 excluded / 14 retry. Re-synced `database_summary.json`/`.js` and `Full Database.xlsx`.

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `css/main.css`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/Full Database.xlsx`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.11.14] - 2026-07-08

### Purged all 404/422 `excluded` entries from the database; added a reusable purge script

Per user decision, removed all 1,004 entries flagged `excluded` (permanent 404/422 failures) from `data/database.json` outright, rather than just filtering them from views. Before deletion, confirmed all 1,004 `symphony_url`s were already present in `data/storage.csv` (the durable URL backup): nothing is lost; any of them can be re-promoted back into `database.json` unrefreshed later via `scripts/sync_storage_to_database.py` if a symphony ever becomes valid again. Database now has 6,681 entries (down from 7,685).

**Built `scripts/purge_flagged_entries.py`**, a reusable tool for this and future cleanses rather than a one-off: takes one or more `flag` levels as CLI arguments (`excluded`, `caution`, `retry`), aborts with no changes if any purge candidate's URL is missing from `storage.csv` (the safety invariant above, enforced automatically), and regenerates every downstream export in one run (`database.js`, `database_summary.json`/`.js`, `Full Database.xlsx`). Documented in `docs/PRD.md`'s Operational Runbook under "Purging Flagged Full-Database Entries". Tested with a safe no-op call (`retry caution`, 0 matches since those were already cleared, see v1.11.12 below) and an invalid-argument call, both behaved correctly.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/Full Database.xlsx`, `scripts/purge_flagged_entries.py` (new), `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.13] - 2026-07-08

### Reordered trailing fields: `oos_date`, `refresh_date`, `flag`, `error`

Per user decision, reordered the last four keys on every `data/database.json` entry from `flag, refresh_date, oos_date, error` to `oos_date, refresh_date, flag, error`. Cosmetic only, no value changes. Regenerated `database.js`, `database_summary.json`/`.js`, and `Full Database.xlsx`.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/Full Database.xlsx`

---

## [1.11.12] - 2026-07-08

### Reset all `caution`/`retry`-flagged entries to null, queuing them for re-refresh

Per user decision, all 197 entries flagged `caution` (88) or `retry` (109) had `flag`, `error`, and `refresh_date` reset to `null`. This puts them back in the "due" queue for the next `scripts/refresh_full_database.py` run, a fresh API attempt rather than trusting the existing flagged state. `excluded` entries (404/422) were left untouched at this step; see v1.11.14 above for their eventual removal. Regenerated `database.js`, `database_summary.json`/`.js`, and `Full Database.xlsx`.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/Full Database.xlsx`

## [1.11.11] - 2026-07-08

### Split `flag` back into `flag` (category) + `error` (message), per user decision on reflection

After thinking it over, the combined `flag = {"level": ..., "reason": ...}` object from v1.11.8/v1.11.9 wasn't the right shape. Split into two sibling fields: `flag` is now just the plain category string (`"excluded"`, `"caution"`, `"retry"`, or `null`), and `error` holds the original message on its own, a string for script errors, or Composer's `data_warnings` object for `"caution"` rows.

**`scripts/refresh_full_database.py`**: `classify_error()` now returns a plain string instead of a dict; the success path (`apply_backtest_result()`) and both failure branches in `main()` set `entry["flag"]`/`entry["error"]` as two separate assignments instead of one combined object.

**Migrated all 7,685 existing entries**, splitting the `{level, reason}` object into the two fields. Counts unchanged from before the split: 1,004 excluded, 88 caution, 109 retry, 6,484 clean.

**Fixed the other live consumer**: `database.html`'s ⚠ badge, which read `e.flag.level === 'caution'`, updated to `e.flag === 'caution'`.

**Updated `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py`**: `flag` is no longer in the nested-object JSON-serialization list (it's a plain string now); `error` is conditionally serialized only when it's actually a dict (the `data_warnings` case), left as a plain string otherwise, since it's a mixed-type field.

**Tested live** against a mixed batch, 15 clean rows plus 5 already-known `excluded` rows in the same run, deliberately exercising both the success and failure write paths together. Verified correct `flag`/`error` shapes across all four cases (clean, a live `422`, a live `404`, and an existing `caution` row), and confirmed zero entries anywhere in the dataset still use the old combined-object shape.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/Full Database.xlsx`, `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`, `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py`, `database.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.11.10] - 2026-07-08

### Renamed `last_updated`→`refresh_date` and `last_semantic_update_at`→`oos_date`; `oos_date` truncated to `YYYY-MM-DD`

Renamed two fields across the full-database schema (`data/database.json`) for clarity: `last_updated` → `refresh_date` (when this entry's metrics were last successfully refreshed) and `last_semantic_update_at` → `oos_date` (when the symphony's underlying logic was last edited, the out-of-sample reference date). Scoped strictly to `database.json`'s own schema; `strategies.json` and `glossary.json` each have their own independent `last_updated` field, untouched.

`oos_date` is also now truncated to plain `YYYY-MM-DD` at write time, both retroactively (5,795 existing non-null values) and going forward in `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`. Previously it stored the Composer API's full timestamp verbatim, including time-of-day and a named timezone (e.g. `2026-03-16T08:11:33.345904-04:00[America/New_York]`): far more precision than the field is ever used for (the "days since last edit" computation in `database.html`'s `oosDaysValue()` only ever needed the date).

Updated every touchpoint in the full-database pipeline: `scripts/refresh_full_database.py` (write path + staleness check), `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py`, `scripts/import_full_database.py` (legacy bootstrap script, already out of sync with the current xlsx column layout for unrelated reasons, noted in its docstring, not fixed this session), and `database.html` (2 references: the All Strategies "Last Updated" column, and `oosDaysValue()`'s live-computation input).

**Caught and fixed a live regression from the previous flag-consolidation pass**: All Strategies' ⚠ warning badge was still reading `e.data_warnings` directly, which no longer exists after that field was removed in v1.11.9, the badge would have silently gone dark. Fixed to read `e.flag && e.flag.level === 'caution'`.

**Testing:** ran a real `--force 20` live-API batch after the rename and spot-checked results, confirmed correctly-named fields and a properly truncated `oos_date` sourced from an actual API response, not just the retroactive backfill. Also (unintentionally) confirmed a pre-existing, unrelated behavior while testing the staleness check: permanently-`excluded` rows (404/422) never get `refresh_date` advanced on failure, so they always look "due" and would be retried by a plain no-argument run, not new behavior, not fixed this session, just newly visible. Caught the resulting 1,109-row live run early (checkpoint-safe, no data loss) and stopped it since it wasn't the intended test.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/Full Database.xlsx`, `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`, `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py`, `scripts/import_full_database.py`, `database.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.11.9] - 2026-07-08

### Consolidated `flag` as the sole error/warning field, removed `script_errors`/`data_warnings`

Following up on v1.11.8's derived `flag` field: `script_errors` and `data_warnings` are now gone entirely, replaced by `flag` as the single write target.

**Rewrote `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`** to compute and write `entry["flag"]` directly on every API call, a new `classify_error()` helper buckets failures into `"excluded"` (404/422, permanent) or `"retry"` (429/500/503/timeout, transient; unrecognized shapes default to `"retry"` with a printed warning), and success handling inline-classifies the API's `data_warnings` response into `{"level": "caution", "reason": ...}`. No more separate `script_errors`/`data_warnings` writes.

**Stripped `script_errors` and `data_warnings`** from all 7,685 existing entries in `data/database.json`/`.js`: their content is fully preserved in `flag.reason`, nothing was lost. **Deleted `scripts/add_flag_field.py`**, the one-time migration script from v1.11.8; its job (backfilling `flag` from those two fields) no longer applies once the fields don't exist and the refresh script writes `flag` natively.

**Updated the export scripts**: `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py`'s nested-field serialization list dropped `data_warnings` (kept `flag`); regenerated `Full Database.xlsx` (36 columns, down from 38) and `data/database_summary.json`/`.js` (28 fields, down from 30).

**Extensively tested with two independent 50-record live batches** against the real Composer API: 50 from the front of the array (`--force` limit) and 50 from the back (a manual bottom-slice test harness, since the front-only `LIMIT` argument doesn't support slicing from the tail). The second batch hit a real transient `429 Too Many Requests` mid-run, which was correctly classified `{"level": "retry", ...}`: a live test of the failure path, not just the success path. Post-test audit confirmed zero entries retain `script_errors`/`data_warnings`, and `flag.level` counts are internally consistent: 6,484 clean + 88 caution + 109 retry + 1,004 excluded = 7,685.

Scrapped a second proposed change this session (replacing `last_semantic_update_at` with a stored `oos_days` day-count) per user decision, it would have traded the Filter Panel/Leaderboard's current live, always-accurate OOS-days computation for a value that goes stale between refreshes; not pursued.

**Files changed:** `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`, `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py`, `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/Full Database.xlsx`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`. **Deleted:** `scripts/add_flag_field.py`.

---

## [1.11.8] - 2026-07-08

### Implemented: unified `flag` field on the full database, derived from `script_errors`/`data_warnings`

Full database refresh (`scripts/refresh_full_database.py`) finished all 7,685 rows. Re-ran the `script_errors`/`data_warnings` audit against the complete dataset per the gate documented in V1.14 Part B: final counts are 1,113 `script_errors` (14.48%, up sharply from the 1.3% partial-sample figure, concentrated almost entirely in the second half of the run, largely `422`) and 88 `data_warnings` (1.15%).

**Added `scripts/add_flag_field.py`**, a one-time migration that derives a single `flag` field per entry from the existing `script_errors`/`data_warnings` values: `{"level": "excluded" | "caution" | "retry", "reason": ...}` or `null`. Classification checks `data_warnings` first (caution) since a warning only ever occurs on a successful backtest; otherwise `script_errors` is bucketed `excluded` (404/422, permanent) or `retry` (429/500/503/timeout, transient). Final tally across all 7,685 entries: 1,004 excluded, 88 caution, 109 retry, 6,484 clean. Backfilled onto `data/database.json`/`data/database.js`; `script_errors`/`data_warnings` are left untouched as the underlying audit trail.

**Updated and re-ran the downstream exports** to keep everything in sync: `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py` (added `flag` to the nested-object JSON-string serialization list, regenerated `data/Full Database.xlsx`) and `scripts/export_summary.py` (regenerated `data/database_summary.json`/`.js`; `flag` passes through automatically since it isn't in `DROPPED_FIELDS`).

**Documented the new field** in the Full Database JSON Schema (`docs/PRD.md` Section 12) and updated V1.14 Part B's checklist to reflect the field now existing in the data, the UI work to actually read `flag.level` (⚠ badges in All Strategies, default exclusion in Leaderboard/Screener) is still not built. Also flagged an open item: the newly-excluded `422`/`404` rows haven't been spot-checked by hand yet, given how much higher the final error rate came in versus the partial-sample estimate.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `data/Full Database.xlsx`, `scripts/add_flag_field.py` (new), `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.11.7] - 2026-07-08

### Documented: `local-maestro` added to the V4.0 roadmap entry

Reviewed `local-maestro` (`Gabraham4/local-maestro`), an offline, local recreation of MyMaestro.co for multi-strategy portfolio correlation and risk analysis (Returns/Correlations/Volatility/Exposure/Metrics tabs, CARP metric, Plotly.js reports), validated by its author at ~97–99.9% accuracy against the real MyMaestro.co. Folded it into the existing V4.0 roadmap section in `docs/PRD.md` as the fifth candidate fork, alongside the three signal-discovery Python tools and `quantstats-js`. Unlike those four (which analyze a single strategy), `local-maestro` answers a different question, how a set of strategies correlate/diversify each other as a portfolio, and shares `quantstats-js`'s core gap: it needs daily equity-curve series per strategy, which Atlas's `database.json` schema doesn't currently store. Its own `data_loader.py` already solves that data-loading problem for Composer backtest-cache JSON, so it's worth cross-referencing if that schema gap is ever addressed. No code was touched or repos cloned/executed this session, documentation only.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.6] - 2026-07-08

### Documented: `quantstats-js` added to the V4.0 roadmap entry, plus an explicit adaptation-required note for all four tools

Reviewed `quantstats-js` (`whsmacon/quantstats-js`), a zero-dependency JS/Node port of the Python `quantstats` portfolio-analytics library (40+ metrics, HTML tearsheet with 13+ SVG charts), and folded it into the existing V4.0 roadmap section in `docs/PRD.md` alongside the three previously-reviewed Python tools. Unlike those three, it's pure JavaScript and could in principle run client-side, which is more compatible with Atlas's static, no-backend architecture, but it's still authored against Node.js/npm conventions and a raw daily-returns data shape Atlas's `database.json` schema doesn't currently store, so it is not a drop-in either.

Added an explicit **adaptation-required** callout to the V4.0 section that applies to all four candidate tools: each was built as an independent standalone project, and integrating any of them means rebuilding the integration surface against Atlas's actual data layer and static front-end structure, not just installing/cloning them. No code was touched or repos cloned/executed this session, documentation only.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.5] - 2026-07-08

### Documented: V4.0 roadmap entry for signal-discovery/robustness tooling (extreme future state, no implementation)

Reviewed three external repos (`composer_json_fuzz_tester`, `rsi_search`, `strategy_generation`, all `VoxMachina1`) as candidate forks while the full database refresh ran in the background. Added a new **V4.0: Signal Discovery & Robustness Tooling** section to `docs/PRD.md` (Section 14, after V3.0) documenting what each tool does, why it matters (turns Atlas from a strategy *catalog* into a robustness/discovery tool, and gives V2.2 Community Signals a technical engine), and the major architectural implications of ever integrating them, namely that all three are local Python CLI tools requiring their own Tiingo API key and real compute, which conflicts with Atlas's current fully-static, zero-server-cost architecture (Tenet 4). Explicitly marked as extreme future state per user direction: no forking, cloning, or implementation work was done this session, documentation only.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.4] - 2026-07-08

### Planned: V1.14 Noise Filtering plan expanded with a data-quality (error/warning-based) filtering policy

**Resumed the paused full-scale refresh.** `scripts/refresh_full_database.py` restarted against the 3,978 rows still due (3,707 already refreshed out of 7,685 total). Confirmed no new failure pattern emerged versus the pre-pause run, same 404/422/429/500/503/timeout mix.

**Audited every `script_errors` and `data_warnings` value in the database** (partial refresh snapshot, 3,707/7,685 rows processed at audit time): 98 entries (1.3%) carry a `script_errors` value, 40 (0.5%) carry a `data_warnings` value. Breakdown: 42 `404 Not Found` + 45 `422 Unprocessable Entity` (87 total, 1.1% of the database) are permanent, dead symphonies or ones that can't be backtested; 12 are transient (`429`/`500`/`503`/timeout) and will clear on their own via the normal refresh retry cycle. All 40 `data_warnings` share one shape, `"Close price data is not available for TICKER after DATE"`, a mid-backtest delisting on a holding, not a fetch failure.

**Decided and documented the V1.14 data-quality filtering policy** in `docs/PRD.md` (Section 14, V1.14 Part B): entries with a permanent 404/422 error get excluded from default Leaderboard/Screener views (flagged, not deleted); entries with a `data_warnings` value get excluded from default Leaderboard/Screener views too but stay visible in All Strategies with a ⚠ indicator, since the backtest itself succeeded, the metrics are just potentially skewed; entries with a transient 429/500/503/timeout error are left unflagged, since the ongoing refresh's staleness check will retry and clear them. Implementation is explicitly gated on V1.15 (Full-Scale Refresh) finishing first, since the error mix above is from a partial sample and may shift once every row has had a real API attempt.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.3] - 2026-07-07

### Changed: Pushed the full-database code to GitHub (data withheld); fixed a data-loss race condition

**Pushed to `main` (commit `88cf45e`), deliberately partial.** `database.html`, its CSS/JS, and the full-database scripts are now live on composeratlas.com via the "Database" nav link. `data/database.json`/`.js`, `data/database_summary.json`/`.js`, `data/storage.csv`, and `data/Full Database.xlsx` were intentionally left out (all still untracked in git), the live page will fail to fetch its data until those are pushed separately. This is accepted and expected, not a bug; `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` was not modified, since none of the withheld files were ever in its exclusion list to begin with.

**Race condition found and fixed while syncing `storage.csv`.** Ran `scripts/sync_storage_to_database.py` to add 1,197 URLs from `storage.csv` into `database.json` (6,488 → 7,685 entries) while a `refresh_full_database.py` background run was still active. The sync appeared to succeed, but the still-running refresh script had loaded the file into memory *before* the sync and periodically overwrites the whole file with that stale in-memory copy on every checkpoint, silently reverting the sync a few checkpoints later. Caught via a routine entry-count check coming back wrong (6,488 instead of the expected 7,685). Recovered cleanly: stopped the running refresh, re-ran the sync (now nothing to overwrite it), regenerated `database_summary.json`, and restarted the refresh against the correct 7,685-entry file. No data was permanently lost, refresh progress up to that point was real and intact.

**Operational rule added to both scripts' docstrings and `docs/PRD.md`:** never run another script that writes `database.json` while a refresh is running in the background, stop it first.

**Background refresh paused (user request, logging out):** stopped cleanly at 3,706/7,685 entries refreshed. Verified `database.json` is valid and intact before stopping. Safe to resume any time.

**Docs audit:** corrected several "not yet pushed to GitHub" / "stays local" statements across `docs/PRD.md` that were true when written but became stale the moment the code push above happened; updated strategy count (25 → 28) and added the Full Database section to `README.md`, which hadn't been touched all session.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`, `README.md`, `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`, `scripts/sync_storage_to_database.py`, `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`

---

## [1.11.2] - 2026-07-07

### Added: Leaderboard score breakdown modal + Methodology button

Each Leaderboard row's Score cell is now clickable (styled identically to every other value cell, no distinct "link" look, just a hover underline), opening a modal that breaks the score down by all 7 categories and all 20 metrics for that specific strategy, distinguishing "no data" (metric never entered the ranking) from "scored zero" (present, but bottom of the pack).

A "Methodology" button next to Filter opens a second modal explaining the model in plain language: percentile-rank scoring, the clamp curve, missing-data handling, and tier assignment, plus the full category/metric point-value breakdown.

Both modals share one component (`openModal()`/`closeModal()`, a single `#modal-overlay` in the page), closable via the × button, clicking outside the panel, or Escape. Widened from 640px to 880px after the first pass looked cramped for the metric list. Also narrowed the Leaderboard's Rank column (was taking up more width than its short content needed).

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `css/main.css`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.1] - 2026-07-07

### Added: Synced 1,197 new URLs from storage.csv into database.json

`data/storage.csv` had grown to 7,685 URLs (from its 6,489 seed at creation, v1.10.1), 1,197 of them not yet present in `data/database.json`. New `scripts/sync_storage_to_database.py` (safe to re-run) adds any storage.csv URL missing from database.json as a new, unrefreshed entry (every field null except `symphony_url`/`symphony_id`), so the next `refresh_full_database.py` run picks them up like any other due row. `database.json` grows from 6,488 to 7,685 entries; `data/database_summary.json` (the Performance Fix's slim derivative, V1.16) regenerated to match, still ~80% smaller than the full file.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json`, `data/database.js`, `data/database_summary.json`, `data/database_summary.js`, `scripts/sync_storage_to_database.py` (new), `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added: Performance Fix, Filter Panel, Screener, and Leaderboard all shipped together

Built out of roadmap order at the user's explicit request: Performance Fix (originally V1.16) done first, then V1.11 (Filter Panel), V1.12 (Screener), and V1.13 (Leaderboard) in one batch. All four still gated behind the "not yet pushed to GitHub" rule, none of this is live.

**Performance Fix.** Found the "<500KB" target this item was framed around is actually scoped to the homepage specifically (Section 10), not database.html, a mistake in earlier docs, corrected rather than carried forward. The real problem was still worth fixing: `database.json` had grown to ~11.5MB as the background refresh populated more rows. Dropping 8 unused fields alone only saved ~26%, most of the weight was JSON format overhead (repeating ~29 field names as keys across 6,488 objects), not any field's data. The actual fix: a **columnar** format (`{fields: [...], rows: [[...], ...]}`) plus **rounding floats to 4 decimal places**. Result: ~11.5MB → ~2.3MB uncompressed (79.9% reduction), ~540KB gzipped in production. New `scripts/export_summary.py` derives `data/database_summary.json`/`.js` from `database.json`; `database.html` now loads the summary file and reconstructs row objects client-side via `rowsFromColumnar()`.

**Filter Panel (V1.11).** Shared searchable field-picker + operator (`=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `between`, `contains`) + value filter, stackable rows (AND logic), Cancel/Apply. 20 filterable fields including a `holding` type matching tickers against `last_market_days_holdings`. One `createFilterController()` factory, three independent instances (All Strategies, Screener, Leaderboard).

**Screener (V1.12).** Reuses the Filter Panel. Three switchable column views (Overview, Risk-Adjusted, Distribution) built in full now rather than deferred, per explicit decision. Order-by dropdown skipped in favor of the existing click-to-sort column headers.

**Leaderboard (V1.13).** The 20-metric, 1,000-point, 7-category scoring model (locked in v1.10.7) implemented for real: `computeScores()` (percentile rank + clamp curve per metric) and `computeTiers()` (rank-based S/A/B/C/F cuts with round-up ties, S+ for a perfect score). Eligibility gated on `sharpe_ratio` being present (the "has been refreshed" proxy used throughout this session). Ships without noise-exclusion, an accepted, documented gap, since Noise Filtering (V1.14) doesn't exist yet.

Also removed OOS Days from the All Strategies table display per a mid-session request (kept in the underlying data for filter/scoring use, just not shown as a column there).

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `css/main.css`, `scripts/export_summary.py` (new), `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.10.7] - 2026-07-07

### Changed: Leaderboard scoring model finalized and validated against real data

Docs-only change, no code yet (implementation is still V1.13, not started). Final iteration on the scoring methodology after a full metric-by-metric review.

**Final model: 20 metrics, 1,000 points, 7 categories** (up from the earlier 10-metric/4-category version): Return (200: ARR, Median), Trailing Returns (100, split across 1yr/3mo/1mo/2wk), Risk-Adjusted (200: Sharpe/Calmar/Sortino/Win Rate at 50 each), Downside Risk (200: Max Drawdown, Standard Deviation, `min` removed as likely redundant with Max Drawdown for this leveraged-ETF-heavy dataset), Asymmetry/Shape (100, split across Skewness/Tail Ratio/Kurtosis), Concentration/Fragility (100, split across the three Top-Day-Contribution metrics, lower=better), Longevity (100: Backtest Days 75 / OOS Days 25).

**Explicitly excluded, each with a documented reason:** Cumulative Return, Mean, Max, Herfindahl Index, Total Costs, Annualized Turnover, Min.

**Validated live:** implemented the full model in a throwaway script and ran it against the 2,282 database entries refreshed so far. Confirmed the math works correctly end to end, and the top-25 output surfaced real, expected noise: roughly half the top 25 were the same underlying strategies double/triple-counted via TESTPORT ports and clone/copy duplicates. This is exactly the problem Noise Filtering (V1.14) exists to solve. Decision: accept this as a known, temporary gap rather than reordering V1.13/V1.14, Leaderboard ships first without noise-exclusion and picks it up once V1.14 lands.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.10.6] - 2026-07-07

### Added: "Metrics" tab on database.html

New tab next to Screener explaining every metric available in `database.json` (29 total, across Return, Risk, Risk-Adjusted, Consistency/Concentration, Trading Behavior/Cost, and Longevity categories) in independent, plain-English descriptions, no explanation references another metric by name, so each one stands alone. Static `.prose`-styled content, same component used for glossary detail pages, no data loading required.

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.10.5] - 2026-07-07

### Changed: Leaderboard scoring model finalized (all decisions locked)

Docs-only change, no code. Every open question from v1.10.4 is now answered.

**Locked model:** 10 metrics, 100 points each, 1,000 total, across 4 equal-standing categories: Return (ARR, trailing 1yr), Risk-Adjusted (Sharpe, Calmar, Sortino, Win Rate), Risk-Safety (Max Drawdown, Std Deviation), Longevity (backtest_days, OOS days). Percentile-rank + clamp curve per metric (`100 × (percentile - 0.22) / (1 - 2×0.22)`), clamp constant kept at 0.22 for launch with re-evaluation explicitly deferred to post-rollout as its own checklist item. Missing data is a hard zero against a fixed 1,000 denominator. Noise-flagged entries excluded from the ranking pool entirely. Tier split kept at S/A/B/C/F 10/10/20/25/25% with an S+ carve-out for a perfect score.

**Sequencing conflict flagged, not resolved:** Leaderboard (V1.13) excludes noise-flagged entries by design, but Noise Filtering (V1.14) ships after it per the confirmed roadmap order, so the `is_noise` flag won't exist yet when Leaderboard first launches. Documented in `docs/PRD.md` as an open decision rather than silently working around it.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.10.4] - 2026-07-07

### Added: Leaderboard scoring methodology documented (V1.13)

Docs-only change, no code. Fetched and read the sibling Individual Stocks site's screener source (`github.com/Azqato/stocks`: `screener.js`, `screener.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`) to understand its relative-percentile scoring model, per the user's request to base the Leaderboard's tier list on the same methodology.

**Methodology captured in full:** weighted pillars summing to 100, percentile-rank-based scoring (not raw value) with a clamp curve (`20 × (percentile - 0.22) / (1 - 2×0.22)`, bottom/top 22% flattened) that keeps a perfect 100 rare, missing data scored as a hard zero against a fixed denominator, and rank-based tiers (S/A/B/C/F at 10/10/20/25/25%, plus a special S+ for perfect scores) with ties rounding up into the better tier.

**Proposed (not decided) pillar translation** for our schema: Return (ARR, trailing 1yr) ~ stock Growth pillar; Risk-Adjusted (Sharpe, Calmar, Sortino) ~ Valuation pillar; Risk/Safety (Max Drawdown, Std Deviation) ~ Balance Sheet pillar; Win Rate/backtest length/turnover/costs as context-only, weight-0 columns.

**Explicitly left open, flagged as real decisions needing confirmation, not assumptions:** exact pillar/metric/weight assignments, whether `backtest_days` should gate scoring eligibility outright (a 6-month vs. 15-year backtest aren't comparable the way two mature stocks are) rather than just being a context column, whether the 0.22 clamp constant transfers as-is given how different our ARR distribution shape is from stock fundamentals, whether Noise Filtering (V1.14) should exclude flagged entries from the percentile pool before scoring, and whether the 10/10/20/25/25 tier split fits a 6,000+ entry pool the same way it fits ~100-500 stocks.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.10.3] - 2026-07-07

### Changed: Roadmap reordered (V1.11-V1.16)

Docs-only change, no code. Per explicit sequencing decisions: the shared filter panel (searchable field-picker + operator + value, from the community "Symphony Search Tool" reference) is now its own near-term roadmap item, built first, ahead of and reused by the Screener tab. Screener now comes before Leaderboard. Noise Filtering moves to after Screener Tab creation, rather than before Leaderboard as originally sequenced.

**New order:** V1.11 Filter Panel (Shared Component) → V1.12 Screener Tab → V1.13 Leaderboard Tab → V1.14 Noise Filtering → V1.15 Full-Scale Refresh → V1.16 Performance Fix → V2.0 Full Database Goes Public.

All cross-references updated (the "not yet pushed to GitHub" gate, the Performance Fix gate, the Section 6 in-progress checklist).

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.10.2] - 2026-07-07

### Changed: Nav restructured; Individual Stocks and Leveraged Strategies moved off primary nav

Top navigation reordered to **About, Strategies, Database, Glossary, Support** (was Strategies, Glossary, Database, About, Individual Stocks, Leveraged Strategies, Support). Footer nav reordered to match.

Removed the direct external nav links to Individual Stocks and Leveraged Strategies, originally added in v1.5.7. The sites aren't gone, they're presented instead on `about.html` in a new "More From Azqato" section: a short description of what each sibling site is, how it relates to Composer.trade and this library, and a CTA button linking out to it.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `about.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.10.1] - 2026-07-07

### Changed: Renamed full_database.json to database.json; added storage.csv URL backup

**Rename.** `data/full_database.json` and `data/full_database.js` are now `data/database.json` and `data/database.js`. The `window.FULL_DATABASE_DATA` global is now `window.DATABASE_DATA`, matching the `STRATEGIES_DATA`/`GLOSSARY_DATA` naming convention already used elsewhere. Updated every reference: `database.html`, `scripts/import_full_database.py`, `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`, `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`. Script filenames were intentionally left as-is, only the data files were renamed. Historical `docs/PATCHNOTES.md` entries describing past work under the old filename were left untouched as an accurate record of what happened at the time, rather than rewritten.

**Resumed the full-scale refresh.** Paused since v1.9.5 pending this rename; now running against the renamed `database.json`, 6,127 rows due.

**Added `data/storage.csv`.** A single-column (`url`), append-only, deduplicated backup of every Composer symphony URL ever shared, referenced, or added to the site, independent of whether it ever backtested successfully. Its purpose is durability: `database.json` can be rebuilt, re-scoped, or have entries dropped (e.g. by the upcoming Noise Filtering pass), but `storage.csv` is meant to never lose a URL once it's been seen. `symphony_url` (here just `url`) is the primary key, one row per unique symphony regardless of how many times it's been discussed. Seeded with 6,489 unique URLs from the union of `database.json` and `strategies.json`. Documented in `docs/PRD.md` Section 12.

**Also fixed:** Section 12's Metric Display Guidelines still documented percentages as rendering to 2 decimal places; corrected to 1, matching the `formatPct()` change made earlier in the session but never reflected in the docs at the time.

**Files changed:** `data/database.json` (renamed from `data/full_database.json`), `data/database.js` (renamed from `data/full_database.js`), `data/storage.csv` (new), `database.html`, `scripts/import_full_database.py`, `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`, `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added: 3 new strategies (28 total)

- **10d BND vs. 10d SPHB (Original)** (`bnd-vs-sphb`, symphony `0HCtnEKGw1PRt8Om77a3`): Contrarian semiconductor strategy using relative BND vs. SPHB RSI(10) as a regime signal. Buys SOXL when bonds outperform high-beta stocks (risk-off = contrarian long), holds SHV when high-beta leads (risk-on = cash). UVXY RSI tiers (74/84) and SOXX/SOXL RSI guards refine the bond-leading regime. ARR 100.6%, max DD 70%, ~14.7-year backtest from SPHB's May 2011 launch date. Tags: `rsi`, `leveraged-etfs`, `mean-reversion`, `vix-tiers`.
- **Dip Buying Tech** (`dip-buying-tech`, symphony `98cACZSS00eDg8Kv5BBV`): Three-branch educational baseline: SPY above 200d MA = hold SPY; SPY below 200d MA = hold XLP (consumer staples); XLP default except when QQQ RSI(10) < 30 = dip-buy XLK (1x tech ETF). Backtested from April 1999 through the dot-com crash. ARR 14.0%, max DD 26.3%, 27.2-year backtest. Tags: `rsi`, `200d-ma`, `mean-reversion`.
- **Ob Os Staple my Bonds (Original)** (`ob-os-staple-bonds`, symphony `OmMmeWyyAu0IRN2yOP6k`): Conservative two-signal strategy: QQQ RSI(10) <= 30 = buy unleveraged QQQ; otherwise hold whichever of XLP or VBF (Invesco Bond Fund) has the lower RSI(10). V0.0 original baseline of a multi-version series (V0.0/1999, V0.1/2007, V0.2/2010, V0.3/2011). ARR 17.4%, max DD 19.6%, 27.2-year backtest. Tags: `rsi`, `mean-reversion`.

## [1.9.5] - 2026-07-07

### Tested: Composer API rate limits (4 tests, token-bucket behavior identified)

Before committing hours of wall-clock time to the sequential (1-call-per-2-seconds) full-scale refresh, paused it at 140/6,488 clean rows to test whether a faster approach was viable.

**Four one-time tests against `/backtest`, at four different rates:**
- ~100 req/sec (100-worker thread pool, 10 batches): 25 succeeded, then `HTTP 429: Too Many Requests` on the remaining 975
- ~20 req/sec (20-worker thread pool): 25 succeeded, then 429s
- ~2 req/sec (2-worker thread pool): 25 succeeded, then 429s
- Sequential 1 req/sec (no concurrency at all): 25 succeeded, then 429s

Every test topped out at exactly 25 successful calls regardless of rate, from 1 req/sec all the way to 100 concurrent req/sec. Combined with the fact that the original 0.5 req/sec throttle (1 call per 2 seconds) sustained 140 consecutive calls with zero failures, this points to a token-bucket limiter: burst capacity of ~25 requests, refilling at roughly the already-proven-safe 0.5 req/sec rate. At 0.5 req/sec, consumption matches the refill rate so the bucket never empties; at any faster rate, the initial bucket drains and every call after the 25th gets throttled regardless of how much faster than "25 per window" the attempted rate was. Likely enforced by a Cloudflare layer in front of the documented 500 req/sec API limit, not the API's own application-layer limit. No data corruption resulted from any of the four tests: failed calls set `script_errors` but never touch `last_updated`, so every rate-limited row is still correctly queued as "due" for the next run. Early-bail safeguards (stop after 3 consecutive failures) were added to each test script and worked correctly, avoiding wasted retries once a test had clearly hit the wall.

**Conclusion:** the existing sequential 1-call-per-2-seconds throttle in `refresh_full_database.py` is the only rate confirmed safe for a sustained run; no further rate testing is planned. 240 rows now carry the full v1.9.1 schema (140 from the paused sequential run + 25 from each of the 4 tests). Documented in `docs/PRD.md` Section 13's Rate Limits table. Resuming the full sequential background refresh remains a normal next step.

## [1.9.4] - 2026-07-07

### Added: xlsx export tool; started full-scale refresh; fixed table width clipping

**xlsx export tool.** `data/Full Database.xlsx` stopped being written to back in v1.9.0 (`data/full_database.json` became the canonical source), so it's been silently going stale ever since. Added `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py`, a local-only, occasional-use script (the reverse direction of `import_full_database.py`) that regenerates the spreadsheet from the current JSON on demand. Nested fields (`last_market_days_holdings`, `active_asset_nodes`, `data_warnings`) are serialized to a JSON string per cell since spreadsheet cells can't hold nested structures. Not run automatically, not part of the deploy pipeline, meant to be triggered manually every so often (e.g. monthly) for offline review.

**Full-scale refresh started early.** Added a `--force` flag to `refresh_full_database.py` (the normal 7-day staleness check would otherwise skip the ~110 rows already touched in earlier passes, leaving them permanently missing the v1.9.1 field expansion). Launched `refresh_full_database.py --force` in the background against all 6,488 entries. This is V1.12's work on the roadmap; started now rather than waiting for its turn, since it's a multi-hour, throttled, I/O-bound job that can run unattended while Noise Filtering, Leaderboard, and Screener get built in the foreground. Verification and recovery-rate measurement against the roadmap's V1.12 checklist still happens once it completes.

### Fixed: All Strategies table clipped by the page's max-width

The table's rightmost columns (Win Rate, Backtest, Last Updated) were cut off, hidden behind the page's normal `1280px` container without an obvious way to see them beyond scrolling. Added a `.db-table-bleed` wrapper that lets the table break out to `92vw` (capped at `1600px`, centered) on viewports 1300px and wider, giving it natural side padding instead of either staying clipped or running edge-to-edge. Below 1300px the table stays in the normal container and scrolls horizontally as before.

**Files changed:** `scripts/export_full_database_to_xlsx.py` (new), `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`, `database.html`, `css/main.css`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.9.3] - 2026-07-07

### Changed: All Strategies table redesigned to match a reference community tool

Reformatted `database.html`'s All Strategies table against a reference screenshot of a community Composer symphony search tool: dense sortable columns, a toolbar header with a result-count pill, sticky first column, and icon-style first/prev/next/last pagination. All of it built with the site's existing dark palette, `Inter`/`JetBrains Mono` typography, and green/pink color-coding conventions, no new dependencies or visual language introduced.

**Public column set finalized** (via clarifying questions, since this table is user-facing): Symphony, ARR, 1-Year Trailing Return, Max Drawdown, Sharpe, Calmar, Sortino, Win Rate, Backtest Length, Last Updated, and a Data Warnings indicator. Deliberately excluded for now: Cumulative Return, Standard Deviation/Volatility, skewness/kurtosis/tail ratio, annualized turnover, and total costs, kept off the public table as more advanced metrics better suited to a future detail view or the Screener's advanced filters.

**Sorting:** click any sortable column header to sort the full dataset (not just the visible page) ascending/descending; entries with a null value for the sorted field always sort last regardless of direction.

**Symphony column:** widened to a fixed 420px with ellipsis truncation and a `title` tooltip for the full name, several community-authored names in this dataset run well past 100 characters and don't reasonably fit unwrapped.

**Security fix found in the process:** `name` values in this dataset come from many different community authors (unlike the curated 25 strategies, which are hand-entered), so they were being inserted into `innerHTML` and an HTML `title` attribute without escaping, an XSS risk if any entry ever contained something like `<script>` or a stray `"`. Added an `escapeHtml()` helper and applied it everywhere `name` renders, plus `encodeURI()` on `symphony_url`.

**Copy fix:** the page's intro paragraph previously claimed this was "every symphony pulled from Composer.trade." Corrected: it's a community-sourced database gathered from many locations, not a first-party Composer.trade export.

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `css/main.css`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.9.2] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed: database.html failed to load on file:// protocol

`database.html` shipped in v1.9.0 with `fetch()`-only data loading and no `window.*_DATA` global fallback, the pattern every other page on the site uses (documented since v1.0.3). Opening the page via `file://` (double-clicking the HTML file, the primary way this local-only feature has been reviewed so far) failed with "Failed to load database / Failed to fetch," since browsers block `fetch()` on `file://` due to CORS.

**Fix:**
- Added `data/full_database.js`, assigns `window.FULL_DATABASE_DATA`, same convention as `data/strategies.js` and `data/glossary.js`
- `scripts/import_full_database.py` and `scripts/refresh_full_database.py` now write the `.json` and `.js` twins in sync on every run, matching how `update_metrics.py` keeps the curated 25's twin files in sync
- `database.html`'s data loader (`loadFullDatabase()`) now checks `window.FULL_DATABASE_DATA` first and only falls back to `fetch()` when the global is absent
- Verified via local HTTP server smoke test and `.js` syntax validation

**Files changed:** `database.html`, `data/full_database.js` (new), `scripts/import_full_database.py`, `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.9.1] - 2026-07-07

### Added: Full Database target schema expansion (not yet public)

Locked and implemented the target schema for `data/full_database.json`, decided via 7 clarifying questions covering which API fields to capture, schema shape, null-handling, and refresh policy.

**Decisions:**
- Capture all newly-discovered `stats` fields from Section 13's earlier findings: `sortino_ratio`, `win_rate`, `skewness`, `kurtosis`, `tail_ratio`, concentration metrics (`top_one_day_contribution`, `top_five_percent_day_contribution`, `top_ten_percent_day_contribution`, `herfindahl_index`), `annualized_turnover`, and finer trailing windows (1-day/1-week/2-week)
- Capture both `last_market_days_holdings` and `active_asset_nodes` now, ahead of the Screener (V1.11), rather than deferring
- Capture costs as one summed `total_costs` field rather than the per-category breakdown or skipping entirely
- Capture `data_warnings`
- Schema shape: flat top-level fields, matching `strategies.json` convention (no nested sub-object)
- Null handling: every entry always has the same keys; unrefreshed or not-yet-meaningful fields are explicit `null`, never omitted
- Refresh policy: full overwrite of the metrics block on every successful API call, no partial backfill logic

**Correction found during live validation:** `active_asset_nodes` is not a ticker list as originally assumed in v1.9.0's API notes, it's a dict of internal node UUID → weight. Real ticker holdings live in `last_market_days_holdings` instead. Corrected in `docs/PRD.md` Section 13, and the Screener roadmap item (V1.11) updated to use the correct field.

**What was added:**
- `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`: rewritten to capture the full 17-field extended schema per successful API call, via a new `apply_backtest_result()` helper
- `scripts/import_full_database.py`: now initializes the 17 extended fields to `null` on a fresh xlsx import, so schema shape is consistent regardless of import path
- All 6,488 existing entries in `data/full_database.json` migrated in place to carry the new keys (`null` where not yet refreshed under the new schema); the 105 rows already refreshed in v1.9.0 were not disturbed
- Validated live against 5 real symphonies, 0 failures; confirmed the new fields populate correctly

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added: Full Database Foundation (not yet public)

Started work recreating, on composeratlas.com itself, the daily metrics-refresh pipeline that `data/Full Database.xlsx` was originally built for. That file holds 6,488 symphonies scraped by an external Google Apps Script that hit its daily `urlfetch` quota; only 953 rows ever got usable metrics, the remaining 5,535 carry the error `Exception: Service invoked too many times for one day: urlfetch.` and no data. This release lays the foundation to fix that using Composer's real API, and to eventually build a Leaderboard and Screener on top of the full database. **Nothing in this release is deployed or linked from the public site's deploy pipeline yet**; it stays local until the roadmap items in PRD.md Section 14 (V1.9-V1.12) are complete.

**Investigation findings:**
- Confirmed live against 5 real symphonies that Composer's actual API (`POST /api/v0.1/symphonies/{id}/backtest`) returns far more data per call than `strategies.json` currently captures: `sortino_ratio`, `win_rate`, `skewness`, `kurtosis`, `tail_ratio`, concentration metrics, live holdings (`last_market_days_holdings`), cost breakdown (`costs`), and finer trailing-return windows. Documented in `docs/PRD.md` Section 13.
- The full database contains significant non-strategy noise: test ports (`TESTPORT #NNN`), "Invest Copy" duplicates, "Copy of Copy of..." chains, and WIP builds mixed in with real strategies. Flagged as a roadmap item (noise filtering) before any full-database view goes public.

**What was added:**
- `data/full_database.json`: canonical JSON source for the full ~6,500-symphony database, imported from the raw xlsx (`max_drawdown` sign normalized to match `strategies.json` convention)
- `scripts/import_full_database.py`: one-time, re-runnable xlsx → JSON importer
- `scripts/refresh_full_database.py`: resumable, checkpointed (every 10 rows) API refresh script; on failure, pastes the API's actual error text into `script_errors` instead of guessing. Validated live against 105 rows (5 + 100 in a follow-up batch) with 0 failures.
- `database.html`: new tabbed page (All Strategies / Leaderboard / Screener). All Strategies renders a paginated table (50 rows/page) against the full dataset with select metrics (ARR, Max DD, Sharpe, Calmar, Backtest Days, Last Updated); Leaderboard and Screener render a "Coming Soon" empty state.
- `.db-tabs`, `.db-tab-panel`, `.db-table`, `.db-pagination` component patterns added to `css/main.css` and documented in `docs/DESIGN.md`
- "Database" nav link added to desktop nav, mobile nav, and footer (`js/app.js`)
- `docs/PRD.md` Section 14 Roadmap: added versioned plan V1.9 through V2.0 covering full-scale refresh, target schema expansion, noise filtering, Leaderboard, Screener, and the data-weight fix required before this can go public (`full_database.json` is ~4MB, over the site's 500KB page-weight target)

**Known limitation carried forward:** `refresh_full_database.py` currently only updates `last_updated` and `script_errors`, not the actual metric fields; full metric repopulation is scoped to V1.9.1.

**Files changed:** `data/full_database.json` (new), `data/Full Database.xlsx` (5 + 100 rows refreshed), `database.html` (new), `css/main.css`, `js/app.js`, `scripts/import_full_database.py` (new), `scripts/refresh_full_database.py` (new), `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added: "Original Strategies" tag marking unmodified baseline logic

Four strategies (The Holy Grail, TQQQ For The Long Term, SOXL Growth, Simon's KMLM Switcher) are the original, unmodified versions of their trading logic, documented alongside a remixed edition elsewhere in the library that adds layers the original build never had, frontrunner-style RSI dip-buys, extra overbought or volatility guards, additional asset legs, and so on. These four now carry a new `original` tag so readers can find the baseline version and compare it against what a later remix added.

**Renamed for clarity (matching the existing "The Holy Grail (Original)" convention):**
- "TQQQ For The Long Term" → "TQQQ For The Long Term (Original)"
- "SOXL Growth v2.4.5 RL" → "SOXL Growth (Original)"
- "Simon's KMLM Switcher" → "Simon's KMLM Switcher (Original)"

**What was added:**
- `original` tag applied to `holy-grail`, `tqqq-long-term`, `soxl-growth-rl`, `simons-kmlm-switcher` in `data/strategies.json` / `data/strategies.js`
- New "Original Strategies" glossary entry (`data/glossary.json` / `data/glossary.js`, 20 concepts total) explaining what the tag means and why the baseline version is worth keeping alongside its remix
- `.tag-original` CSS class and `TAG_CLASSES` / tag-label entries in `js/app.js`
- `scripts/add_original_tag.py`: reproducible, re-runnable script that performed the renames, tag additions, and glossary entry in sync

### Changed: External nav links open in a new tab

"Individual Stocks" and "Leveraged Strategies" in the top nav now open in a new tab (`target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`), matching the existing behavior of the "Support" link, since all three point to external sites outside this repo.

### Fixed: Documentation drift after recent library growth

Full pass over README, PRD, DESIGN, and `about.html` to reconcile stale figures and pipeline descriptions against the current site state:
- Strategy count corrected from 24 to 25 in `README.md` and `about.html`
- Glossary concept count corrected from 19 to 20 across `docs/PRD.md`
- PRD Section 4 (Non-Goals) no longer claims there's no automated metric pipeline: `.github/workflows/update-metrics.yml` has run `scripts/update_metrics.py` daily since v1.6.x, corrected here
- PRD Section 11 runbook rewritten to describe the daily automated refresh (with 7-day staleness skip and self-healing retry) instead of a stale "run monthly" manual instruction
- DESIGN.md's tag color table now includes the previously-undocumented `zoop` tag and the new `original` tag
- `scripts/update_metrics.py` docstring no longer hardcodes a stale strategy count
- PRD Section 14 (Roadmap) V2.0 "Tag-based filtering on strategy index" item expanded to describe filtering by the tag taxonomy already generated for every strategy (signal, asset class, and collection tags)

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `data/glossary.json`, `data/glossary.js`, `js/app.js`, `css/main.css`, `about.html`, `README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `scripts/add_original_tag.py`, `scripts/update_metrics.py`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-22

### Chore: Full em-dash audit and removal across all project files

Removed all 696 em-dash instances (Unicode U+2014) from every project file: HTML pages, documentation, JavaScript, CSS, and JSON data. No HTML entity `: ` forms were found. Double-dash `--` sequences were audited and confirmed to be Markdown/CSS syntax only, not punctuation substitutes, so no changes were made there.

**Replacement rules applied by context:**

- `**Label**: description` for bold label introductions (was `**Label** [em-dash] description`)
- `` `code`: description `` for inline code labels (was `` `code` [em-dash] description ``)
- `### Heading: Subtitle` for heading separators (was `### Heading [em-dash] Subtitle`)
- `Title: Site Name` for page title separators (was `Title [em-dash] Site Name`)
- Comma for mid-sentence asides in prose
- Semicolon for adjacent independent clauses
- Parentheses for supplementary information

**Files changed:** `404.html`, `about.html`, `glossary.html`, `index.html`, `strategies.html`, `README.md`, `js/app.js`, `css/main.css`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `data/glossary.json`, `data/glossary.js`, `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`

**Writing Style documented:** PRD Section 19 "Writing Style" added. Covers the em-dash prohibition (both literal U+2014 and `: ` entity), approved replacement patterns, a pattern table, the double-dash rule, and the audit process.

---

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-22

### Changed: Homepage: "Longest Backtest" stat + sort by backtest length

Added a fifth stat to the homepage stats bar: **Longest Backtest**, which reads `~15 yrs` (the max `backtest_days` across all strategies, rounded to nearest year).

Also changed the homepage strategy grid sort order from the default JSON order to **longest backtest first**, so strategies with the most validated history surface at the top.

**Files changed:** `index.html`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added: AI Summary section on every strategy page

Every strategy detail page now opens with an **AI Summary**: a Claude-authored analysis displayed in a distinct purple-accented box directly above the "How It Works" section. For each strategy, Claude reviews the symphony's structure, assets, signals/logic, performance metrics, and backtest period, then explains in plain English **why** someone would follow it, the **purpose** behind its logic, and any **noteworthy characteristics**: short backtests, deep drawdowns, or period-dependent returns that warrant skepticism.

The summaries are deliberately even-handed in line with the Transparency Over Hype and Education Before Promotion tenets: strategies with spectacular-but-short backtests (e.g. s90 Half Low Catch at ~2 years / +735% ARR, Simon's KMLM Switcher at ~4 years / +654% ARR) and those with catastrophic drawdowns (Inside Nancy Pelosi's Chips −86%, SOXL Growth v2.4.5 RL −82%, Calmar ≤ 1.0) are explicitly flagged so readers discount the headline figures appropriately.

**What was added:**
- New `ai_summary` field (array of paragraph strings) on all 25 strategies in `data/strategies.json` and `data/strategies.js`, inserted immediately before `how_it_works`
- `AI Summary` render block in `strategies.html`, placed above How It Works; renders nothing when the field is absent
- `.ai-summary` component (box, header, ✦ mark, paragraphs) in `css/main.css`
- `scripts/add_ai_summary.py`: reproducible, re-runnable script that holds every summary keyed by slug and writes both data files in sync

**Process documented:** PRD Section 11 gains a "Generating the AI Summary" runbook; the streamlined URL-based add-strategy workflow now drafts `ai_summary` automatically; Section 12 schema documents the new field; DESIGN.md documents the `.ai-summary` component.

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `strategies.html`, `css/main.css`, `scripts/add_ai_summary.py`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added: Simon's KMLM Switcher strategy (strategy #25)

Added Simon's KMLM Switcher (`simons-kmlm-switcher`) to the strategy library, bringing the total to 25 strategies. Symphony ID: `u5iBJE751BM5FKPRJvKf`.

**Strategy overview:** A three-layer RSI engine that first screens 11 market tickers for overbought conditions (routing to UVXY), then cascades through 4 leveraged ETF dip-buy checks at extreme oversold levels, and finally runs a core KMLM momentum switch, holding the two most oversold assets from {TECL, SOXL, SVIX} when tech leads, or rotating to the stronger of {SQQQ, TLT} when managed futures momentum dominates.

**Key metrics (backtest from ~April 2022, 1,049 trading days):** ARR +654.3%, Max DD −32.0%, Sharpe 3.01, Calmar 20.4. Highest ARR, Sharpe, and Calmar in the library.

**Tags:** `rsi`, `momentum`, `leveraged-etfs`, `managed-futures`, `inverse-etfs`, `vix-tiers`

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.5.9] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed: Site-wide accuracy audit (strategies, glossary, counts)

Full fact-check of every strategy, glossary concept, and HTML page. Corrected numbers and superlatives that had drifted out of sync after the library grew from the original 12 zoop symphonies to 24 strategies and after backtest-metric refreshes.

**Counts & dynamic stats:**
- `about.html`: "12 strategy symphonies" → "24"
- `index.html`: the homepage "Concepts" stat was hardcoded to `8`; it now reads `glossary.length` (19)
- Glossary "Zoop's Strategies", "11 strategies in this collection" → "12"; added the missing 12th row (SOXL Growth 2026) and rebuilt the whole stats table to current ARR/Sharpe/Max DD values
- `zoops-soxl-growth-2026` was missing the `zoop` tag: added, so it now appears under the Zoop's Strategies concept

**Stale metric citations corrected to match `strategies.json`:**
- Excellent Adventure 1-yr trailing +190.8% → +170.0%; Manhattan 3-mo −9% → −1.5% and Calmar 4.41 → 4.43; Leveraged TQQQ 1-yr +120.2% → +120.4%; Safety Checks Max DD ~43.7% → ~43.5%; Holy Grail 2026 cumulative 44,142x → 44,866x
- KMLM Switcher Calmar 9.75/10.31 → 9.52 and Sharpe 2.66 → 2.63 (glossary Calmar/Managed Futures sections too); backtest ≈5.3 yrs → ≈5.5 yrs
- s90 Half Low Catch backtest "~1.5 years" → "~2.2 years" (551 trading days ÷ 252); also in PATCHNOTES s90 entry
- Glossary Sharpe range "1.65 to 2.70" → "~1.10 to 3.04"; Calmar "In Practice" Frontrunner 4.62 → 4.23, Sometimes TQQQ 5.61 → 5.22; Max Drawdown range floor "−65% (SOXL Growth)" → "−86% (Inside Nancy Pelosi's Chips)"; ARR range updated

**Superlatives corrected (no longer true at 24 strategies):**
- zoop SOXL Growth "highest-risk/return strategy in the library" → "among the zoop symphonies"
- SOXL Growth RL "highest max drawdown" → "second-highest (behind Inside Nancy Pelosi's Chips)"
- s90 "most volatile in the library" → "second only to SOXL Growth v2.4.5 RL"; Wooden ARKK "second-highest std dev" → "among the highest"; SPY/Energy/Chips "lowest Sharpe/Calmar" → "among the lowest"; several "other 11 strategies" / library-only-uniqueness claims rescoped to the zoop set

**Files changed:** `index.html`, `about.html`, `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `data/glossary.json`, `data/glossary.js`, `scripts/add_glossary.py`, `scripts/add_zoop.py`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.5.8] - 2026-06-15

> **Duplicate version number, flagged 2026-08-24.** A second entry numbered `[1.5.8]` appears a few
> entries below this one, dated 2026-07-09. **This entry, dated 2026-06-15, is the real 1.5.8**: it
> falls in correct sequence between `[1.5.9]` and `[1.5.7]`, and its date matches its neighbours. The
> other one is a misnumbering. Neither has been renumbered.

### Changed: Brand name displayed as "Composer Atlas" (with a space)

The site's display name is now rendered as **Composer Atlas** (two words) instead of the previous one-word **ComposerAtlas**. This applies everywhere the name appears as a brand/product label: page `<title>` tags, the nav logo text, the footer copyright, the hero eyebrow, the About page, and all body/glossary prose that references the library by name. Documentation (PRD, DESIGN, README, this changelog) was updated to match.

Literal technical identifiers were intentionally left unchanged because they are real strings, not display text:

- The GitHub repository (`Azqato/composer`) and its prior name (`Azqato/ComposerAtlas`)
- Historical GitHub Pages URLs and route-table paths (`/ComposerAtlas/...`)

No functional or routing behaviour changed, this is a presentation-only rename.

**Files changed:** `index.html`, `about.html`, `glossary.html`, `strategies.html`, `404.html`, `js/app.js`, `css/main.css`, `data/glossary.js`, `data/glossary.json`, `scripts/add_glossary.py`, `scripts/add_zoop.py`, `README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

## [1.5.8] - 2026-07-09

> **Misnumbered entry, flagged 2026-08-24.** This is dated 2026-07-09, almost a month after the
> `[1.13.x]` releases, yet carries version `1.5.8`, which is already taken by the brand-rename entry
> above dated 2026-06-15. It is a documentation-only change that appears to have been written up
> against a stale version number, and it is filed in the wrong place in the file as a result.
> **Not renumbered and not moved**, per PRD Section 22. Its date is the reliable field.

### Docs: V2.3 RSI Signals Page added to roadmap

Added a detailed implementation plan for the Live RSI Signals page as roadmap item V2.3 in `docs/PRD.md`. No code changes in this patch.

**Plan covers:** purpose and context (Frontrunner signal universe), full ticker list (20 tickers), RSI formula spec (Wilder's 10-period smoothing), two data-source options (Python refresh script vs. live client-side fetch) with tradeoffs and a recommended starting approach, `data/rsi.json` schema, `scripts/refresh_rsi.py` responsibilities, `rsi.html` page design (table layout, default sort, color-coding thresholds for 5 signal levels), CSS additions, nav placement decision, complete file change list, and four open questions to resolve before implementation begins.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.5.7] - 2026-06-15

### Added: "Individual Stocks" and "Leveraged Strategies" nav links

Added two new top navigation links between "About" and "Support", pointing to sibling Azqato sites:

- **Individual Stocks**: links to `https://azqato.github.io/stocks/` (same tab)
- **Leveraged Strategies**: links to `https://azqato.github.io/leveraged-strategies/` (same tab)

Both links appear in the desktop nav, mobile nav drawer, and follow the existing nav link rendering pipeline. They open in the same tab (no `target="_blank"`) unlike the Support link.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`, `docs/PRD.md`

---

## [1.5.6] - 2026-06-15

### Added: "Backtesting" glossary concept (19th entry)

Added a comprehensive glossary entry for `backtesting` covering the full lifecycle of how backtests work, both in general and specific to Composer.trade's engine.

**Sections included:**
- **Definition**: what backtesting is and its role as an evaluation tool vs. a prediction tool
- **How It Works**: simulation mechanics, cost accounting, importance of data range and market regime coverage
- **Common Backtesting Pitfalls**: survivorship bias, look-ahead bias, overfitting (data dredging), curve fitting
- **Backtesting vs. Forward Testing**: paper trading as the live-environment complement
- **How Composer.trade Runs Backtests**: daily rebalance lag, adjusted price data, what costs ARE and are NOT modeled (expense ratios embedded in NAV; commissions/spreads not modeled)
- **Reading a Composer Backtest**: CAGR, max drawdown, Sharpe, benchmark comparison, ETF launch date constraints; includes summary table of the four core metrics
- **Limitations of Backtesting**: regime change risk, short leveraged ETF history (TQQQ ~15 years), overfitting risk in Composer's condition-rich environment

**Files changed:** `data/glossary.json`, `data/glossary.js`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`, `docs/PRD.md`

---

## [1.5.5] - 2026-06-15

### Infra: Move ad-hoc scripts to `scripts/` folder

Moved `_add_glossary.py` and `_add_zoop.py` from the project root into `scripts/` (renamed to `add_glossary.py` and `add_zoop.py`, dropping the underscore prefix). Updated all internal file paths from hardcoded absolute Windows paths to the portable `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent` pattern used by `update_metrics.py`. Deleted the originals from the project root.

Documented the convention in `docs/PRD.md`: all Python scripts must live in the `scripts/` folder. Directory structure updated to list all three scripts. Tech stack table updated to note the `scripts/` convention.

**Files changed:** `scripts/add_glossary.py` (new), `scripts/add_zoop.py` (new), `docs/PRD.md`
**Deleted:** `_add_glossary.py`, `_add_zoop.py` (project root)

---

## [1.5.4] - 2026-06-15

### Fix: Improve disabled text legibility

Updated `--color-disabled` from `#444444` to `#c0c0c0` globally. This affects all secondary UI text: stat bar labels ("Strategies", "Best Sharpe", "Top ARR", "Concepts"), breadcrumb separators, section counts, and strategy card metadata. The previous value was near-invisible against the dark background.

**File changed:** `css/main.css`

---

## [1.5.3] - 2026-06-15

### Added: "Zoop's Strategies" glossary concept and tag

Added a glossary entry for `zoop` covering who Zoop (Azqato) is, the design philosophy behind his strategy suite, and an overview of all 11 zoops-* strategies with their headline metrics. Added the `zoop` tag (orange) to all 11 zoops-* strategies, with a label and CSS class so it renders distinctively on strategy cards.

**Files changed:** `data/glossary.json`, `data/glossary.js`, `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `js/app.js`, `css/main.css`

---

## [1.5.2] - 2026-06-15

### Added: 9 new glossary concepts (17 total)

Added rich multi-section entries for nine new concepts referenced throughout the site:

**Indicators:** Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), MACD

**Strategy Concepts:** Mean Reversion, Volatility Decay

**Risk Metrics:** Standard Deviation, Annualized Rate of Return (ARR)

**Asset Classes:** Managed Futures, Inverse ETFs

Each entry includes Definition, How It Works, In Practice, Limitations, and an extended "Building in Composer.trade" section with strategy-specific examples from the library. Added new tags to relevant strategies (`macd`, `mean-reversion`, `standard-deviation`, `managed-futures`, `inverse-etfs`) so related strategy counts are populated on glossary cards. Updated tag label display in `js/app.js`.

**Files changed:** `data/glossary.json`, `data/glossary.js`, `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `js/app.js`

---

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-15

### Fix: Glossary card titles are now clickable links

Made the concept name in each glossary card a clickable anchor link pointing to the detail page (`glossary.html?slug=…`), matching the existing behavior on strategy cards.

**File changed:** `js/app.js`

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added: 6 new strategies (24 total)

Added six new Composer symphonies to the strategy library, expanding the catalog from 18 to 24 strategies. Each entry was analyzed from the Composer API backtest metrics and logic tree, with full `how_it_works` narrative, `signals` breakdown, and `risk_profile` section.

| Strategy | Symphony ID | ARR | Max DD |
|---|---|---|---|
| SOXX Group | `7PBSP926Mp40r6bPnP0j` | 111.2% | -69.2% |
| SOXL Growth v2.4.5 RL | `CW8oWU12S6vEvn2Hh7jD` | 143.1% | -82.5% |
| Inside Nancy Pelosi's Chips - V3 | `HgK8mCeBnH4fQFNcfZ7q` | 73.1% | -86.2% |
| Top Cap by MA + RSI ETF Hedge | `wadbe3IfwvSES5vk6yiu` | 133.3% | -57.8% |
| Mean Reversion Comparison to Python Code | `KJqNBGxYyyKuCcEfdHhq` | 81.8% | -81.7% |
| SPY, Energy, Chips, Commodities | `rtyBIBOKEY2cPSbJSQX8` | 73.9% | -65.3% |

**Notable additions:**
- **SOXX Group**: Garen/DN's K Wave V6 system with the '30-20-10 Double Pop' multi-timeframe RSI cascade for semiconductor mean-reversion
- **SOXL Growth v2.4.5 RL**: Reinforcement-learning-optimized SOXL strategy; identified by ML-precision decimal thresholds (RSI <= 62.1995, StdDev <= 4.9226) and highest drawdown in the library (82.5%)
- **Inside Nancy Pelosi's Chips - V3**: Semiconductor mean-reversion using SOXX 5-day momentum extremes and individual NVDA/AMD RSI signals at extreme thresholds (RSI > 90 and < 15)
- **Top Cap by MA + RSI ETF Hedge**: Minimalist 3-branch strategy: SPY RSI(6d) >= 90 → UVXY; RSI(6d) <= 28 → leveraged attack [TQQQ,LABU,SPXL]; normal → mega-cap momentum filter [WMT,MSTR,AMZN,KO,BRK/B,AAPL,TSLA]
- **Mean Reversion Comparison to Python Code**: Built to cross-validate a Python backtest; minimal SPY MA + TQQQ RSI(10d) logic that serves as a performance baseline vs Holy Grail
- **SPY, Energy, Chips, Commodities**: VIXM RSI(40d) Black Swan Catcher paired with a multi-sector rotator spanning [SOXX,NVDA,AMD,SPY,DBC,XLE,ENPH]

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `README.md`

---

## [1.4.2] - 2026-06-14

### Fix: Repo-rename-proof BASE URL detection

Replaced hardcoded string matching in the `BASE` detection with a hostname check:

```js
// Before, breaks whenever the repo is renamed
const BASE = (_seg && _seg.toLowerCase() === 'composer') ? '/' + _seg : '';

// After, detects GitHub Pages by host; works regardless of repo name
const BASE = (window.location.hostname.endsWith('.github.io') && _seg) ? '/' + _seg : '';
```

The previous approach required updating the string literal every time the GitHub repository was renamed (from `ComposerAtlas` → `composer` in v1.4.1). The new approach detects GitHub Pages environments by their `*.github.io` hostname and automatically uses whatever the first path segment is as the base. Behaviour is identical on all environments: GitHub Pages gets `/composer`, localhost gets `''`, `file://` is handled separately in `u()`.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-14

### Infra: GitHub repository renamed from `ComposerAtlas` to `composer`

The GitHub repository was renamed from `Azqato/ComposerAtlas` to `Azqato/composer`. The GitHub Pages URL changed accordingly.

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Repository | `https://github.com/Azqato/ComposerAtlas` | `https://github.com/Azqato/composer` |
| Live site | `https://azqato.github.io/ComposerAtlas/` | `https://azqato.github.io/composer/` |

**Critical fix; `js/app.js` BASE detection:** The `BASE` constant is derived from the first URL path segment and used to prefix all internal links. Before: checked for `'composeratlas'` (case-insensitive). After: checks for `'composer'`. Without this fix all navigation and deep links would resolve to the server root.

```js
// Before
const BASE = (_seg && _seg.toLowerCase() === 'composeratlas') ? '/' + _seg : '';

// After
const BASE = (_seg && _seg.toLowerCase() === 'composer') ? '/' + _seg : '';
```

**Also updated:** `robots.txt` sitemap URL, `README.md` clone/live/actions URLs, `docs/PRD.md` live URL, repository URL, route table, and BASE detection code example.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `robots.txt`, `README.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added: 5 new strategies (18 total)

Added five new Composer symphonies to the strategy library, expanding the catalog from 13 to 18 strategies. Each entry was analyzed from the Composer API logic tree and includes full `how_it_works` narrative, `signals` breakdown, and `risk_profile` section.

| Slug | Name | ARR | Max DD | Sharpe | Calmar | Days |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `holy-grail` | The Holy Grail (Original) | 153.9% | -47.4% | 1.80 | 3.24 | 3,693 |
| `tqqq-long-term` | TQQQ For The Long Term | 165.4% | -53.6% | 1.86 | 3.08 | 3,693 |
| `wooden-arkk` | Wooden ARKK Machine 2.2 | 244.2% | -44.5% | 2.25 | 5.48 | 1,028 |
| `super-semiconductors` | Super Semiconductors | 102.6% | -42.9% | 1.71 | 2.39 | 3,614 |
| `four-horsemen` | The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse | 166.8% | -45.3% | 2.18 | 3.68 | 3,629 |

**Strategy highlights:**
- **Holy Grail** uses TQQQ's own 200d MA as the trend gate (not SPY), with a 5% rebalance corridor rather than daily rebalancing; bear mode uses sequential dip-buys on TECL/SOXL and a SQQQ/BSV RSI filter.
- **TQQQ For The Long Term** gates on SPY's 200d MA with dual overbought checks (TQQQ RSI + SPXL RSI); bear mode adds SQQQ dip-buy as an unusual re-entry into the inverse position after market bounces.
- **Wooden ARKK Machine 2.2** is a pure mean-reversion system: IEI vs SPHB RSI(7) selects the regime, then buys the single worst-performing asset from a 7-ETF long pool (risk-off) or 5-ETF inverse pool (risk-on) using 4-day MA sort.
- **Super Semiconductors** (Dereck Nielsen) uses SPY EMA(8)/SMA(200) gate + MACD on SMH to switch between top-3 stock selection from a 19-stock universe, partial SHY/SMH hedge, SOXL dip-buy, or bear-mode SOXS short.
- **Four Horsemen** runs multiple parallel components with different time horizons, the most complex logic tree in the library: QQQ 252d return < -20% activates a deep bear routing protocol with tiered thresholds and bear-rally detection.

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `README.md`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Consolidated 12 documentation files into 4 canonical documents: README.md, docs/PRD.md, docs/DESIGN.md, docs/PATCHNOTES.md
- Moved all operational, technical, API, schema, roadmap, security, and tenet content into docs/PRD.md as consolidated sections
- README.md rewritten as developer-facing quick-start (no marketing language)
- docs/DESIGN.md expanded to include all required sections: philosophy, full color palette, typography, spacing, breakpoints, component patterns, accessibility, animation
- File naming standardized from .MD to .md

### Removed
- docs/ComposerAPI.MD (content moved to PRD.md § Composer API Reference)
- docs/GLOSSARY-SCHEMA.MD (content moved to PRD.md § Data Schemas)
- docs/METRICS.MD (content moved to PRD.md § Data Schemas)
- docs/PRFAQ.MD (content moved to PRD.md § FAQ)
- docs/ROADMAP.MD (content moved to PRD.md § Roadmap)
- docs/RUNBOOK.MD (content moved to PRD.md § Operational Runbook)
- docs/SECURITY.MD (content moved to PRD.md § Security)
- docs/TENETS.MD (content moved to PRD.md § Tenets)
- docs/TRD.MD (content moved to PRD.md § Architecture & Technical Reference)
- README.MD (root, uppercase) replaced by README.md (lowercase)

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-14

### Docs: Documented URL-based strategy addition workflow

Added "Adding a Strategy from a Composer URL (Streamlined)" section to `docs/RUNBOOK.MD`: the preferred method for adding new strategies. Documents the full automated workflow: extract symphony ID from URL, fetch backtest metrics and logic tree from the Composer API (no auth required), AI analysis of IF/ELSE logic tree to draft all content fields, name/slug proposal with user confirmation, and dual-file insertion into `data/strategies.json` + `data/strategies.js`.

The prior "Adding a New Strategy" workflow is retained and renamed "Manual" for cases where the API is unavailable.

**Files changed:** `docs/RUNBOOK.MD` (v1.7 → v1.8), `docs/PATCHNOTES.MD`

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-14

### Refactor: Consolidated folder structure: flat root .html files

Eliminated the `strategies/` and `glossary/` subdirectories entirely. Each section's listing and detail views are now served from a single root-level `.html` file.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `strategies/index.html` (listing) | `strategies.html` (listing + detail) |
| `strategies/detail/index.html` (detail) | ↑ same file, `?slug=X` triggers detail view |
| `glossary/index.html` (listing) | `glossary.html` (listing + detail) |
| `glossary/detail/index.html` (detail) | ↑ same file, `?slug=X` triggers detail view |

**How it works:** Each combined page checks `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('slug')` on load. `null` → render listing into `#content`; non-null → render detail view for that slug. Same file, same assets, different render path.

**URL changes:**

| Old URL | New URL |
|---|---|
| `/ComposerAtlas/strategies/` | `/ComposerAtlas/strategies.html` |
| `/ComposerAtlas/strategies/detail/?slug=X` | `/ComposerAtlas/strategies.html?slug=X` |
| `/ComposerAtlas/glossary/` | `/ComposerAtlas/glossary.html` |
| `/ComposerAtlas/glossary/detail/?slug=X` | `/ComposerAtlas/glossary.html?slug=X` |

**`u()` simplified** (`js/app.js`): Removed depth-detection logic (no longer needed, all pages are at root depth 0). `file://` path now just strips the leading `/` and maps `'/'` → `'index.html'`. Function shrank from 12 lines to 5.

**Files changed:** `strategies.html` (new), `glossary.html` (new), `js/app.js`, `index.html`, `404.html`, `docs/RUNBOOK.MD` (v1.6 → v1.7), `docs/PATCHNOTES.MD`

**Deleted:** `strategies/index.html`, `strategies/detail/index.html`, `glossary/index.html`, `glossary/detail/index.html`

---

## [1.1.9] - 2026-06-14

### Fix: s90 50/40 maxDD: remove incorrect 2026 Frontrunner reference

The `how_it_works` and `risk_profile` content incorrectly stated the strategy paired with "the 2026 Frontrunner." It uses a different frontrunner component. Updated all three occurrences to "a frontrunner component" / "the frontrunner component", neutral phrasing that doesn't assert which frontrunner is used.

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.MD`

---

## [1.1.8] - 2026-06-14

### Feature: Strategy card titles are now clickable links

Strategy card titles (`<h2 class="card-title">`) now link to the strategy detail page, identical to the "View Strategy →" button on each card. Clicking the title navigates to `/strategies/detail/?slug=...`.

**Implementation:** Wrapped `s.name` in an `<a>` tag inside `renderStrategyCard()`. Added `.card-title a { color: inherit; text-decoration: none; }` so the link inherits the heading color and the existing `.card:hover .card-title { color: var(--color-green); }` rule applies naturally, hovering the card turns both the title text and the link green with no additional CSS required.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `css/main.css`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.MD`

---

## [1.1.7] - 2026-06-14

### Content: Added Low Catchers strategy (13th symphony)

Added **s90 50/40 maxDD (Half Low Catch)** (`s90-half-low-catch`), a multi-asset extreme dip-buying strategy that pairs the 2026 Frontrunner with a dedicated low-catching component.

**Strategy summary:**

The low-catchers component is a waterfall of extreme oversold conditions across 9+ 3x leveraged ETFs. Entry thresholds are the tightest in the library (RSI 14–22). The strategy only deploys in catastrophic conditions: QQQ 10-day MA return < -2.4%, SOXL 1/2/5-day crash thresholds (-31%/-37%/-57%), UVXY RSI > 88 (extreme fear), or individual ETF RSI bottoms across LABU, YINN, UDOW, FAS, TNA, URTY, KORU, NAIL, and others.

**Key metrics (as of 2026-06-14, backtest 551 days):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Annualized Return | 735% |
| Max Drawdown | -29.6% |
| Sharpe Ratio | 3.04 |
| Calmar Ratio | 24.8 |
| Standard Deviation | 79.7% |
| Backtest Days | 551 (~2.2 yrs) |

**Important:** Backtest covers ~2.2 years only (from early 2024). Metrics reflect a predominantly bull market and should be interpreted with caution.

Metrics fetched via Composer API (`POST /api/v0.1/symphonies/K8ql2SKFd4VDBemIstEr/backtest`).

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `docs/PATCHNOTES.MD`

---

## [1.1.6] - 2026-06-13

### Design: 🗺️ emoji replaces "CA" monogram as site logo and favicon

Replaced the green "CA" monogram with the 🗺️ map emoji across all logo touchpoints.

**favicon.svg**: Replaced the dark-background rectangle + "CA" JetBrains Mono text with a plain 32×32 SVG that renders the emoji. All 7 HTML pages already reference `favicon.svg` via `<link rel="icon">` so no HTML changes were needed.

**Nav logo mark** (`js/app.js`); Changed `<span class="nav-logo-mark">CA</span>` to `<span class="nav-logo-mark">🗺️</span>`.

**`.nav-logo-mark` CSS** (`css/main.css`); Removed `font-family: var(--font-mono)`, `font-weight: 700`, and `color: var(--color-green)` (irrelevant to emoji rendering). Replaced with an emoji-safe font stack (`'Segoe UI Emoji'`, `'Apple Color Emoji'`, `'Noto Color Emoji'`) and bumped `font-size` to `1.25rem` for visual balance.

**Files changed:** `favicon.svg`, `js/app.js`, `css/main.css`

---

### Docs: Strategy building best practice added to PRD

Added a "Content Notes (Pending Placement)" section to `docs/PRD.MD` to stage content destined for the website. First entry: avoid lookback periods shorter than 10 days to prevent overfitting and OOS drift.

**Files changed:** `docs/PRD.MD`

---

## [1.1.5] - 2026-06-08

### Fix: Stats bar values now use primary white color

Homepage stats bar numbers (12 Strategies, Best Sharpe, Top ARR, 8 Concepts) were inconsistently colored, the Sharpe and ARR values had `text-green` class applied, making them green while the Strategies and Concepts counts were white. All four stat values now consistently use `--color-primary` (`#f0f0f0`).

**Files changed:** `index.html`

---

## [1.1.4] - 2026-06-08

### Docs: Full documentation audit: all 12 docs updated to reflect v1.1.x site state

All documentation files in `docs/` updated to match the current state of the live site. No code changes.

**Files changed:** `docs/TRD.MD`, `docs/DESIGN.MD`, `docs/METRICS.MD`, `docs/PRD.MD`, `docs/ROADMAP.MD`, `docs/SECURITY.MD`, `docs/GLOSSARY-SCHEMA.MD`, `docs/PRFAQ.MD`

---

## [1.1.3] - 2026-06-08

### Design: Footer simplified to match azqato.github.io

Replaced the multi-column footer (logo, tagline, nav links, disclaimer block) with a clean centered layout matching the spacing and approach of azqato.github.io.

**Before:** Two-column flex layout with logo/tagline on the left, nav links on the right, a divider, and a stacked disclaimer block below. `padding: 40px 0`.

**After:** Single centered column. `padding: 2rem`, `text-align: center`. Three elements stacked:
1. Nav links row (centered, `gap: 16px`)
2. One-line legal disclaimer (`max-width: 560px`, `color: --color-disabled`)
3. Copyright + "Built by Azqato" attribution

**Files changed:** `css/main.css`, `js/app.js`

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-08

### Fix: All internal links broken on GitHub Pages (case-sensitive BASE detection)

Every internal link generated by `u()` was broken on the live GitHub Pages deployment, nav links (Strategies, Glossary, About), strategy card "View Strategy" buttons, breadcrumbs, sidebar links, and error-state back buttons. Only hardcoded relative URLs (like the homepage hero CTA) were immune.

**Root cause:** `BASE` was computed as:
```js
const BASE = window.location.pathname.startsWith('/composeratlas') ? '/composeratlas' : '';
```
The GitHub repository is named `ComposerAtlas` (capital C), so the live URL path is `/ComposerAtlas/...`. The case-sensitive `startsWith` check always failed, `BASE` became `''`, and every `u()` call produced an absolute path from the server root (e.g. `/strategies/detail/`) instead of `/ComposerAtlas/strategies/detail/`.

**Fix:** Extract the first URL path segment and compare case-insensitively, preserving actual casing from the live URL:
```js
const _seg = window.location.pathname.split('/')[1];
const BASE = (_seg && _seg.toLowerCase() === 'composeratlas') ? '/' + _seg : '';
```

Also updated the homepage hero Glossary CTA to route through `u('/glossary/')` via JavaScript instead of a hardcoded `href="glossary/"`, making it consistent with every other internal link on the site.

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`, `index.html`

### Cleanup: Pre-Launch Optimization

Cleaned up project structure and deployment pipeline in preparation for the initial GitHub Pages launch.

**Deploy workflow** (`deploy.yml`): Previous workflow uploaded the entire repository to GitHub Pages, including files that should never be publicly served. Updated to use `rsync` to build a clean `_site/` folder before upload. Files now excluded from deployment:

- `data/symphony_scores.json`: 14MB raw EDN logic tree data; for AI analysis only, not user-facing
- `docs/`: Internal project documentation (RUNBOOK, TRD, PATCHNOTES, etc.)
- `scripts/`: Python data sync scripts
- `strategies.xlsx`: Source spreadsheet reference
- `README.MD`, `.gitignore`, `.github/`: Dev/CI config

**CSS**: Removed unused `--color-green-muted: #00a854` custom property. It was defined in `:root` but never referenced anywhere in the stylesheet.

**JS**: Removed unused `i` parameter from `renderBreadcrumb`'s map callback.

**Files changed:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `css/main.css`, `js/app.js`, `docs/RUNBOOK.MD` (v1.5 → v1.6)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-08

### Content: Logic Tree Analysis: Full Strategy Rewrites

All 12 strategy pages have been rewritten from scratch based on analysis of the actual IF/ELSE logic trees stored in `data/symphony_scores.json`. The previous content was generic placeholder text that did not accurately reflect how each symphony works. This release corrects the record.

**What changed per strategy:**

| Field | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `how_it_works` | 2-3 generic paragraphs describing momentum/rotation | 3 precise paragraphs derived from actual logic tree structure |
| `signals` | Approximate: often missing or mislabeled | Verified against actual IF branches: ETF tickers, RSI thresholds, and conditions confirmed |
| `tags` | Multiple errors (see below) | Corrected per actual logic used |
| `risk_profile` | Cited stale metric figures | Updated to match current API metrics; stale Calmar/return figures removed |

**Tag corrections across all 12 strategies:**

- `rsi`: Added to all 12 strategies (was missing from Frontrunner, TQQQ FTLT, Safety Checks, KMLM Switcher, UPRO FTLT)
- `vix-tiers`: Added to all 12 strategies (all use UVXY RSI >65 via the Frontrunner component; tag was absent from most)
- `200d-ma`: Removed from Frontrunner (no SMA comparison exists in its logic tree); correctly added to TQQQ FTLT, UPRO FTLT, Safety Checks, Leveraged TQQQ Symphony where absent
- `200d-ma`: Removed from KMLM Switcher and SOXL Growth (neither uses a Price > SMA signal in its terminal logic)
- `max-drawdown`: Added to SOXL Growth; this is the only strategy using MaxDD as a primary regime gate
- `200d-ma`: Removed from SOXL Growth (MaxDD is the primary signal, not an SMA comparison)

**Key content corrections (selected highlights):**

- **Frontrunner**: Recharacterized from "momentum/trend-follower" to "cash-first dip-buying strategy that defaults to BIL T-bills", the actual behavior
- **KMLM Switcher**: Removed description of KMLM ETF as the switching instrument; actual switch signal is XLK (Technology SPDR) relative RSI; LABU biotech dip-buy documented
- **Sometimes TQQQ**: Documented multi-period RSI (10/20/60/100), 6 cumulative return windows (1d/6d/10d/60d/62d/252d), and full bond cross-asset signal set (TLT/BND/IEF/AGG/CORP/PSQ)
- **Safety Checks**: Documented 10-condition ensemble voting structure (the most accurate description of its behavior)
- **Manhattan Project**: Documented BIL RSI yield signal, 8-ETF leveraged basket on SPY RSI <30, and 20+ ETF universe
- **SOXL Growth**: Documented MaxDD(SOXL) ≥50% regime gate, standard deviation thresholds (3.8%/4.92%/5.41%/18%), and TMF/TMV in-position Treasury pairing

**Process:** See RUNBOOK.MD § "Re-Analyzing Strategy Logic Trees" for the full documented procedure.

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`, `docs/RUNBOOK.MD` (v1.4 → v1.5)

---

## [1.0.9] - 2026-06-08

### Data: Symphony logic trees fetched and stored for analysis

Added `data/symphony_scores.json` containing the full IF/ELSE logic tree for all 12 symphonies, fetched from `GET /api/v0.1/symphonies/{id}/score`. This file is for AI analysis and future reference only, it is not served to the website.

Updated `scripts/update_metrics.py` to also refresh `symphony_scores.json` on every run, keeping logic trees in sync alongside backtest metrics. Run the script monthly (or whenever symphonies are edited) to keep all data current.

**Files changed:** `data/symphony_scores.json` (new), `scripts/update_metrics.py`, `docs/RUNBOOK.MD` (v1.3 → v1.4)

---

## [1.0.8] - 2026-06-08

### Data: Live backtest metrics refreshed via Composer API

All 12 strategy metrics updated by fetching fresh backtest data directly from the Composer API (`POST /api/v0.1/symphonies/{id}/backtest`). No API key required.

Updated fields per strategy: `annualized_rate_of_return`, `max_drawdown`, `cumulative_return`, `calmar_ratio`, `sharpe_ratio`, `standard_deviation`, `min`, `mean`, `median`, `max`, `trailing_one_month_return`, `trailing_three_month_return`, `trailing_one_year_return`, `backtest_days`, `last_updated`.

**Files changed:** `data/strategies.json`, `data/strategies.js`

**Added:** `scripts/update_metrics.py`: reusable Python script to refresh all metrics on demand. Run with `python scripts/update_metrics.py` from the project root.

---

## [1.0.7] - 2026-06-08

### Fix: Secondary text legibility across all pages

Lightened the `--color-secondary` CSS token from `#888888` to `#b0b0b0`. This improves readability of all body/description text on a dark background, including the hero subtitle, strategy descriptions, glossary concept descriptions, how-it-works paragraphs, prose section text, and card descriptions.

**Files changed:** `css/main.css`

---

## [1.0.6] - 2026-06-08

### Glossary: 5-Paragraph Essays for All 8 Concepts

Each glossary concept now includes a dedicated "Building with…" essay section that explains why the concept is useful for systematic investing and shows concrete examples of how to apply it when building symphonies in Composer.trade.

**New sections added to all 8 concepts:**

| Concept | Essay Title |
|---|---|
| RSI | "Building with RSI in Composer.trade" |
| 200-Day Moving Average | "Building with the 200-Day MA in Composer.trade" |
| Momentum Investing | "Building Momentum Strategies in Composer.trade" |
| VIX Tiers | "Building VIX-Tiered Symphonies in Composer.trade" |
| Leveraged ETFs | "Building Systematic Leveraged ETF Symphonies in Composer.trade" |
| Sharpe Ratio | "Using Sharpe Ratio to Build Better Symphonies in Composer.trade" |
| Calmar Ratio | "Using Calmar Ratio to Design Better Symphonies in Composer.trade" |
| Max Drawdown | "Managing Max Drawdown When Building Symphonies in Composer.trade" |

Each essay covers: why the concept matters for systematic investing, how it functions as a signal or metric in a Composer.trade symphony, practical examples of building with it (signal combinations, thresholds, symphony architecture), and limitations to watch for.

**Files changed:** `data/glossary.json`, `data/glossary.js`

No rendering changes required, the existing `glossary/detail/index.html` page renders sections from the data array automatically, so the new essay sections appear without any code changes.

### Nav + Footer: Support link and Azqato attribution

**Navigation**
- Added "Support" link to desktop nav, mobile nav drawer, and footer nav: links to `https://azqato.github.io/support.html` (opens in new tab)
- External links in nav now include `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` automatically via the `external: true` flag on link objects

**Footer**
- Added "Made by Azqato." centered below the copyright line: links to `https://azqato.github.io/` (opens in new tab)

**Files changed:** `js/app.js`

## [1.0.4] - 2026-06-08

### Fix: Navigation broken on file:// protocol

All internal links now work correctly when the site is opened by double-clicking HTML files.

#### Problem

Navigation links in `renderNav()`, `renderFooter()`, and inline page scripts were constructed as `BASE + '/strategies/'`, producing absolute paths like `/strategies/`. On `file://` protocol, `/strategies/` resolves to the filesystem root (e.g., `file:///strategies/`), not relative to the project folder, so every nav click went to a dead 404.

#### Fix

Added a `u(path)` helper function to `js/app.js`:
- On HTTP/HTTPS: returns `BASE + path` (unchanged behavior: absolute paths work fine on a server)
- On `file://`: determines the current page's depth in the directory tree (0 = root, 1 = `strategies/` or `glossary/`, 2 = `strategies/detail/` or `glossary/detail/`) and returns a relative path (e.g., `../../strategies/`) so the browser resolves it correctly

All link constructions across `js/app.js` and the inline scripts in `strategies/detail/index.html`, `glossary/detail/index.html`, and `404.html` have been updated to use `u()` instead of `BASE + '/'`.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-06-08

### File:// Protocol Compatibility: Open Without a Server

The site now works by double-clicking any HTML file directly. No Python server required.

#### Problem

The previous implementation loaded strategy and glossary data via `fetch()`. Browsers block `fetch()` on the `file://` protocol due to CORS restrictions, meaning the site would only work when served over HTTP (e.g., `python -m http.server`).

#### Solution

Converted data loading to a `<script>`-tag-based approach:

**Files Added**
- `data/strategies.js`: Assigns `window.STRATEGIES_DATA = [...]` with all 12 strategies. Loaded before `app.js` via `<script>` tag.
- `data/glossary.js`: Assigns `window.GLOSSARY_DATA = [...]` with all 8 glossary concepts.

**Files Updated**
- `js/app.js`: `loadStrategies()` and `loadGlossary()` now check `window.STRATEGIES_DATA` / `window.GLOSSARY_DATA` first. Falls back to `fetch()` only if the globals are absent.
- All 7 HTML pages: Added `<script src="[path]/data/strategies.js">` and `<script src="[path]/data/glossary.js">` before the `app.js` include. Relative paths adjusted per directory depth.

#### Result

- Open `index.html` by double-clicking: site loads fully, no server needed.
- GitHub Pages continues to work unchanged (HTTP origin, globals are just loaded first).
- Python server still works as before (fetch fallback or globals: both load the same data).
- `data/strategies.json` and `data/glossary.json` remain the source-of-truth files. When updating data, keep the corresponding `.js` files in sync.

#### Documentation Updated

- `docs/TRD.MD` (v1.2 → v1.3), Added `data/*.js` files to directory structure; updated data layer section to describe dual-mode loading (globals + fetch fallback)
- `docs/RUNBOOK.MD` (v1.2 → v1.3), Updated "Adding a Strategy" and "Adding a Glossary Entry" workflows to require updating both `.json` and `.js` files; updated "Local Dev" section; updated troubleshooting

- `glossary/index.html`: Glossary listing with concept cards sorted by category
- `glossary/detail/index.html`: Concept detail: renders all sections with prose formatting, optional formula box, tables; sidebar with related strategies and other concepts
- `about.html`: Static about page with disclaimers and tech stack info
- `404.html`: Custom 404 page

#### Documentation Updated

- `docs/TRD.MD` (v1.1 → v1.2), Updated framework decision to vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, updated directory structure, data access patterns, page routes, deploy pipeline, removed Astro/Tailwind/TypeScript references
- `docs/RUNBOOK.MD` (v1.1 → v1.2), Updated all commands to use Python HTTP server, updated strategy/glossary workflows to target JSON files directly, updated troubleshooting section for vanilla JS issues
