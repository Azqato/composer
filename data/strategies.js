      "Structurally, the Frontrunner is a cash-first dip-buyer: it parks in T-bills (BIL) by default and only deploys into 3x leveraged ETFs (SOXL, TQQQ, or UPRO) when a fast RSI(10) reading crosses tight oversold thresholds, with semiconductors checked first. A second branch uses XLY and UVXY RSI to rotate into volatility (VXX) or a short (SPXU) when markets overheat. The purpose is to spend most of its time earning risk-free interest and act only at genuine short-term extremes, making each entry deliberate rather than continuous. It is also the 50% base component shared by every other zoop symphony, so understanding it explains half of this library.",
      "Over a roughly 8-year backtest it posts a {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized return with a {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown, a notably lower drawdown than the other leveraged zoop strategies precisely because its time-in-market is limited. Its {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and {calmar_ratio} Calmar reflect that favorable risk-adjusted trade-off. The main caveat is that buying into oversold conditions means individual entries can keep falling before they recover, so the smooth equity curve masks sharp single-trade risk. It best suits an investor who wants systematic dip-buying exposure rather than a constant leveraged allocation."

    "how_it_works": [
      "The 2026 Frontrunner is a dip-buying strategy that defaults to T-bills (BIL) and only rotates into leveraged ETFs when extreme short-term RSI signals an oversold entry opportunity. The strategy checks RSI(10), a fast 10-period RSI, against tight thresholds: semiconductors (SMH) below 23, Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) below 28, or S&P 500 (SPY) below 28 each trigger a corresponding 3x leveraged buy (SOXL, TQQQ, or UPRO respectively). Priority is top-to-bottom: semiconductor oversold signals are checked first.",
      "If no oversold condition is detected, the strategy checks for high-volatility or overbought conditions. When consumer discretionary (XLY) RSI exceeds 79, it rotates into VXX (VIX futures ETN) as a volatility hedge. If UVXY RSI exceeds 65, the strategy evaluates SPY's current return vs. its moving-average return: if SPY is trending above its average, it shorts via SPXU; if SPY is underperforming its average, it holds TQQQ instead.",
      "When none of the above conditions fire, the strategy defaults to BIL, a 1-3 month T-bill ETF that earns risk-free interest while waiting for the next actionable signal. This cash-first, extremes-only approach means the Frontrunner is often inactive, making each entry more deliberate than a buy-and-hold strategy. It is also the base component (50% weight) shared by all other zoop symphonies in this library."

Rather than buy-and-hold, it uses the 200-day moving average and RSI/volatility checks to step out of leveraged tech before major breakdowns, then re-enter when conditions stabilize, all on top of the shared Frontrunner dip-buy base. It is built for the investor who believes in Nasdaq 100 growth over the long run but cannot stomach the catastrophic, decay-amplified losses that come from holding a 3x ETF unhedged through a bear market.",
      "Over roughly 14 years it compounds at {annualized_rate_of_return:0}% annualized, but the headline risk is a {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown and {standard_deviation:0} volatility; the safety exits soften the worst leveraged-tech crashes without eliminating them. Its {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and {calmar_ratio} Calmar are typical for this aggressive cohort.

When SPY is in an uptrend and SPXL (3x S&P 500) RSI is below 80, the strategy defaults to holding TQQQ, leveraged Nasdaq exposure during confirmed broad market uptrends. The Frontrunner component (the other 50%) runs in parallel, adding RSI(10) oversold dip-buying for semiconductors, Nasdaq, and S&P.",
      "The second component also includes a single-asset overbought check: if RSI(SMH), semiconductors, exceeds 79, it routes to SH rather than TQQQ, treating semiconductor overextension as a warning for the broader tech-heavy Nasdaq exposure. This is a simplified version of the more elaborate overbought cascade in Holy Grail.",
      "When SPY breaks below its SMA, the strategy shifts to dip-buying mode rather than simply holding cash. It checks TQQQ RSI <31 to buy TECL (3x tech), SPY RSI <30 to buy SPXL (3x S&P), and then works through tiered UVXY checks at 65, 74, and 84 before defaulting to TQQQ or SH based on TQQQ's own price vs. SMA.

      "As the name suggests, this strategy holds TQQQ only when multiple independent signals (RSI, the 200-day MA regime, and volatility filters) simultaneously confirm a favorable entry; otherwise it sits in the defensive Frontrunner base or cash. It is a precision-timing approach: the logic is deliberately selective, trading time-in-market for entry quality, on the thesis that avoiding leveraged exposure during unconfirmed conditions is worth more than capturing every up day.",
      "That selectivity pays off statistically: it records the strongest risk-adjusted profile in the library, a {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and {calmar_ratio} Calmar, alongside a {annualized_rate_of_return:0}% annualized return and the highest backtested cumulative return here, all over a robust 14-year window. Its {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown is meaningfully shallower than the always-in TQQQ variants. The standout characteristic is this efficiency: by being TQQQ 'sometimes' rather than always, it captures much of the upside with materially less of the pain, making it one of the more compelling profiles for risk-aware leveraged investors."

It pairs the Frontrunner with a multi-layer decision tree that interrogates bond market conditions, multi-period momentum, and cumulative return thresholds before committing to TQQQ. The strategy truly only holds TQQQ 'sometimes', when a very specific constellation of cross-asset conditions align. Uniquely, when UVXY RSI exceeds 65, this strategy routes to SH rather than SPXU, making it more conservative on volatility spikes than its siblings.",
      "In uptrend conditions (SPY above SMA), the strategy evaluates 60-period SPY RSI and 100-period QQQ momentum to calibrate between TQQQ and UPRO exposure, with corporate bond (CORP) 60-day cumulative return as a tiebreaker. When Treasury RSI (TLT 20-period) falls below its baseline, signaling rising long rates, the strategy adds further filters: 6-day TQQQ cumulative return thresholds to detect crash conditions, 1-day momentum checks, and multi-period RSI from BND, IEF, and AGG before allowing a re-entry.",
      "In downtrend conditions (SPY below SMA), the strategy uses 60-day and 252-day QQQ cumulative returns to assess bear depth, PSQ (inverse QQQ) RSI as a confirmation signal, and bond relative returns to judge fixed income sentiment. Unlike strategies that simply hold SH when bearish, Sometimes TQQQ actively re-evaluates multiple timeframes and asset classes each day to determine if conditions support a cautious re-entry or continued avoidance."

The design philosophy is drawdown reduction first: each check is a veto gate intended to keep the strategy out of leveraged positions during the conditions that historically precede large losses, while still compounding strongly over the long run.",
      "Over roughly 14 years it returns {annualized_rate_of_return:0}% annualized with a {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown and {standard_deviation:0} volatility; the {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and {calmar_ratio} Calmar are mid-pack for the cohort. In practice the safety checks moderate rather than eliminate leveraged drawdowns, and the deep max drawdown shows that no set of pre-entry filters fully neutralizes 3x ETF risk in a severe selloff.

After the Frontrunner component (50% weight), the second half is itself an equal-weight portfolio of 10 independent safety conditions evaluated in parallel. Each condition tests a different aspect of QQQ's market state: 75-day cumulative return vs. moving-average return, 3-day return vs. standard deviation, 20-period EMA vs. SMA, multi-period RSI levels (10-period, 50-period, 100-period), and Price(QQQ) vs. SMA, checked from multiple angles.",

Because all 10 are equal-weighted, the combined second component holds TQQQ proportional to how many conditions are currently passing, all 10 passing means near-full TQQQ allocation from this component, 5 of 10 means approximately equal TQQQ and SH.",
      "This consensus-voting structure creates a gradual risk-on/risk-off spectrum rather than binary switching. As market conditions deteriorate across multiple metrics simultaneously, the strategy systematically reduces TQQQ exposure signal by signal. Each condition that passes is a vote for equity; each that fails is a vote for defense. The strategy never has a single catastrophic 'gate open' moment, it degrades gracefully across its ensemble of checks."

A unique signal not found in other strategies: LABU (3x Biotech) RSI below 25 triggers a biotech sector dip-buy.",

A 60-period SPY RSI above 60 signals that the market has been trending strongly for an extended period, increasing the risk of a mean-reversion event. The strategy accepts missed upside during these extended runs to reduce exposure near tops.",

Semiconductors are among the highest-beta corners of the market, and 3x leverage on top compounds that volatility. The strategy deliberately accepts extreme swings in exchange for the explosive upside that semiconductor leadership can deliver during a tech bull run.",
      "The numbers make the trade-off explicit: {annualized_rate_of_return:0}% annualized over roughly 14 years, but a brutal {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown and {standard_deviation:0}% volatility, the highest-risk profile of the zoop set, which is why it carries max-drawdown and standard-deviation tags. Its {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and {calmar_ratio} Calmar are respectable only because the returns are so large. This is a strategy for investors with the highest risk tolerance and a long horizon who can psychologically and financially survive losing roughly two-thirds of peak value."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "SOXL Growth is structurally unique in the library: its primary signal is MaxDD (running maximum drawdown) of SOXL rather than a price-vs-SMA comparison. When SOXL's maximum drawdown reaches or exceeds 50%, the strategy enters a 'deep drawdown mode' where it calibrates position size using TQQQ's standard deviation of daily returns as a secondary volatility gauge. Low TQQQ volatility (std-dev ≤ 3.8%) routes to a three-ETF basket of SOXL, TQQQ, and SPXL; higher volatility triggers further branching based on TQQQ RSI and cumulative return readings.",
      "When SOXL's max drawdown is below 50% (a 'normal' drawdown regime), the strategy switches to using SOXL's own RSI and standard deviation. Below RSI 62.2 with low volatility (std-dev ≤ 4.92%), it holds SOXL alone. As RSI or volatility rises, nuanced sub-conditions comparing cumulative returns and MaxDD(TQQQ) thresholds determine whether to stay in SOXL, expand to a basket, or shift to SH.",
      "The risk-on basket in both regimes frequently includes TMF (3x 20-year Treasury Bull) or TMV (3x 20-year Treasury Bear) alongside SOXL, using Treasury duration exposure as a hedge within the leveraged position itself. This Treasury pairing inside an equity basket is a distinctive feature not found in the other zoop strategies, reflecting a more portfolio-construction-aware approach to managing semiconductor 3x leverage."

The 'low catchers' half is a waterfall of extreme oversold triggers across 3x ETFs (semiconductors, biotech, China, financials, small caps, global markets) that stays dormant until an asset reaches a genuine washout, then buys the snapback at RSI levels far below conventional oversold thresholds. The other half is a complete 's90 50/40 maxDD' bull/bear regime strategy that is always invested, rotating between leveraged equity baskets (SOXL, TQQQ, TECL, UPRO), volatility hedges (UVXY, VIXY), and a small BIL/GLD/TLT ballast sleeve.

The backtest is just 2.4 years ({backtest_days} trading days), by far the shortest in the library, and a strategy weighted half toward deep-dip-buying will look extraordinary in any window that happens to contain sharp V-shaped recoveries. These returns are almost certainly not repeatable out-of-sample; the strategy is best viewed as an illustration of the mean-reversion-plus-regime concept rather than a realistic expectation, and the short, period-specific backtest is its single most important caveat."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "This strategy is an equal-weighted 50/50 combination of two independent components that run at the same time. The first, 'low catchers,' is a waterfall of extreme oversold conditions across a diversified basket of 3x leveraged ETFs that holds nothing until a genuine washout appears; unlike the other strategies in this library that use RSI extremes in the 22-31 range, it pushes entry thresholds far lower, as tight as RSI 14 for some ETFs. The second, 's90 50/40 maxDD,' is a complete bull/bear regime strategy (described below) that is always invested. Because the two halves are equal-weighted, the portfolio always has the regime component working even while the low-catchers half waits for a crash.",
      "The low-catchers component opens with two initial gates: if QQQ's 10-day moving-average return falls below -2.4% (broad Nasdaq deterioration), the strategy buys SOXL. If QQQ is not yet weak, it checks for catastrophic SOXL crashes directly, a 1-day return below -31%, 2-day cumulative return below -37%, or 5-day cumulative return below -57% each trigger a SOXL entry. These are flash-crash and multi-day collapse conditions, not routine corrections. When UVXY's 10-period RSI exceeds 88, far above the 65 threshold used elsewhere in this library, the strategy also buys SOXL, treating extreme volatility panic as a contrarian semiconductor buy signal.",
      "After the SOXL-specific triggers, the low-catchers component cascades through individual 3x ETF RSI checks in strict priority order: LABU (3x biotech) RSI < 22, YINN (3x China) RSI < 14, UDOW (3x Dow) RSI < 18, FAS (3x financials) RSI < 15, TNA (3x small cap) RSI < 16, URTY (3x Russell 2000) RSI < 16, KORU (3x South Korea) RSI < 17, NAIL (3x homebuilders) RSI < 15, and additional ETFs further down the tree. Each asset independently catches its own sector's extreme bottom, and if none triggers the low-catchers half simply holds nothing that day. The other half, the 's90 50/40 maxDD' regime strategy, first applies the same SOXL crash gates and then splits on SPY's 200-day moving average into a Bull Market and a Bear Market branch. Each branch runs a long ladder of overbought RSI ceilings that rotate into UVXY or VIXY volatility hedges near froth, holds equal-weighted SOXL/TQQQ/TECL or roughly 80% UPRO when the trend is intact, and in the bear branch reserves a small ballast sleeve of about 6.7% each in BIL, GLD and TLT, the drawdown-control element the '50/40 maxDD' name refers to."

      "The original Holy Grail is a TQQQ-centric trend-follower: it stays long leveraged tech while TQQQ holds above its 200-day moving average, hedges into UVXY when the market is overbought, and rotates into dip-buying or outright short positions once TQQQ breaks below the 200-day line. The logic is a clean three-state machine of bull (long leverage), froth (volatility hedge), and bear (dip-buy or short), designed to participate fully in uptrends while having explicit, pre-defined responses to overheating and to regime breakdown.",
      "Over a long 15-year backtest it returns {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized with a {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and {calmar_ratio} Calmar, while the {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown and {standard_deviation:0} volatility mark it as aggressive. The lengthy test window through multiple bear markets is a meaningful strength, and the explicit short and hedge branches mean it is built to profit from, not merely survive, downturns. It suits investors who want active bull-and-bear leveraged tech exposure governed by a transparent moving-average regime rule."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "The Holy Grail uses TQQQ's own 200-day moving average as the primary regime gate. When TQQQ is trading above its 200d MA, the strategy enters bull mode and holds an RSI-gated TQQQ position. Within bull mode, if TQQQ's RSI(10) exceeds 79, signaling short-term overbought conditions, the position pivots to UVXY (a leveraged long VIX-futures ETF) as a defensive hedge. Otherwise, the strategy holds TQQQ directly. Each state holds a single asset at full weight and the symphony has no fixed rebalance schedule, so it simply stays in the selected position until a signal flips it, keeping turnover tied to how often the regime and RSI gates change.",
      "When TQQQ falls below its 200-day moving average (bear mode), the strategy shifts to opportunistic dip-buying. The first gate checks if TQQQ RSI(10) is below 31; if so, it buys TECL (3x Technology) as the most beaten-up leveraged tech proxy. If TQQQ RSI isn't that extreme, it checks SOXL RSI(10) below 30 and buys SOXL (3x Semiconductors) as an alternative crash entry. These two sequential checks are designed to capture violent capitulation bounces in tech and semiconductor markets during corrections.",
      "If neither dip-buy condition triggers in bear mode, the strategy evaluates TQQQ relative to its 20-day moving average. If TQQQ is also below the 20d MA, it runs a relative RSI filter between SQQQ (3x inverse QQQ) and BSV (short-term bonds), selecting whichever shows higher RSI(10), either profiting from continued Nasdaq decline or rotating to capital preservation. If TQQQ is below its 200d MA but above the 20d MA, the strategy holds TQQQ outright, trusting the shorter-term uptrend to continue within the longer-term downtrend context."

In bull mode it applies two sequential overbought guards: if TQQQ RSI(10) exceeds 79, exit to UVXY; if SPXL (3x S&P500) RSI(10) exceeds 80, also exit to UVXY. These dual checks, one on the QQQ proxy, one on the SPY proxy, catch overbought conditions from two angles. The strategy rebalances daily, unlike the 5% corridor approach used by its cousin Holy Grail.",

The second triggers on SPY RSI(10) below 30, buying UPRO (3x S&P500) on broad-market capitulation. These entries are designed to capture violent mean-reversion bounces at extreme fear levels, the strategy intentionally buys into falling markets at RSI extremes.",

When TQQQ is below the 20d MA, it runs a relative RSI filter between SQQQ (3x inverse QQQ) and TLT (20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), selecting the higher-RSI asset, either pressing the short-Nasdaq trade or taking refuge in long-duration bonds. A secondary check also looks for SQQQ RSI(10) below 31: an unusual signal that buys into the inverse ETF when it itself has become oversold, betting on a mean-reversion bounce in the short position after an extreme market bounce has crushed SQQQ. When TQQQ is above the 20d MA but still in a bear regime, the strategy holds TQQQ outright."

The strong ratios are attractive, but the short record begins around mid-2022 and is skewed toward the high-volatility 2022 to 2025 environment in which fade-the-extreme tactics thrive; the same approach can bleed in calm, persistently trending markets where the worst performer keeps losing.

When bonds show stronger short-term RSI than high-beta equities, the market is in a risk-off or stressed state. When high-beta equities show stronger RSI than bonds, the market is in risk-on mode. This single comparison routes the entire portfolio into one of two diametrically opposed asset pools.",
      "In risk-off regime (IEI RSI(7) > SPHB RSI(7)), the strategy picks from a long leveraged pool: TARK (2x ARKK Innovation), TECL (3x Technology), UPRO (3x S&P500), TMF (3x Long-Duration Treasuries), YINN (3x China equities), EDC (3x Emerging Markets), and SOXX (semiconductor index). Crucially, it selects the BOTTOM performer by 4-day moving average of returns, the single asset that has fallen the most recently. This is a mean-reversion bet: in a risk-off environment, oversold leveraged longs tend to produce the sharpest bounces when sentiment stabilizes.",
      "In risk-on regime (SPHB RSI(7) > IEI RSI(7)), the strategy switches to the bear pool: SARK (short ARKK), PSQ (1x inverse QQQ), TMV (3x inverse long treasury), DRV (3x inverse real estate), and TYO (3x inverse 7-10yr treasury). Again it selects the BOTTOM 4-day performer. The counterintuitive logic: even during risk-on bull markets, inverse ETFs experience sharp drawdowns followed by violent mean-reversion bounces when markets pause or correct briefly. Picking the most beaten-up inverse ETF when stocks are running hot is a bet on short-term mean reversion within a broader trend. Version 2.2 implies prior iterations with different thresholds or pools exist."

      "A semiconductor-sector specialist by Dereck Nielsen, this strategy selects the top 3 performers from a 19-company chip universe during MACD-bullish bull markets, switches to tactical dip-buying and partial bond hedges when MACD turns bearish, and actively shorts semiconductors via SOXS or SSG in confirmed bear conditions. It combines stock-level momentum selection (own the strongest chips) with a sector-level MACD regime switch, so it concentrates in winners during uptrends and flips defensive or short when the sector rolls over.",
      "Over a long 14-year backtest it returns {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized with a {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe, {calmar_ratio} Calmar, and a {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown, a relatively contained drawdown for a single-sector strategy, helped by the bond hedges and short branches. The multi-cycle test window and the genuine bear-market shorting logic are strengths. Its main characteristic is concentration: by living entirely in semiconductors it is fully exposed to chip-cycle booms and busts, rewarding investors who specifically want active, regime-aware exposure to that sector."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "Super Semiconductors, designed by Dereck Nielsen, is built around the thesis that semiconductor leadership can be captured systematically while managing sector-specific risk. The outer gate uses an 8-day exponential moving average of SPY versus SPY's 200-day simple moving average, a more sensitive version of the classic 200d MA filter that reacts faster to trend changes. When SPY EMA(8) is above SPY SMA(200), the strategy enters bull mode with two sequential overbought guards: SPY RSI(10) above 80 triggers a rotation to UVXY, and SPY RSI(60) above 60 triggers rotation into the best-performing asset from [TMF, UUP, VIXY, XLP, SPLV] by 15-day return, a defensive basket covering bonds, dollar, volatility hedges, consumer staples, and low-volatility equities.",
      "When neither overbought guard fires in bull mode, the strategy evaluates SMH using a MACD-style signal: comparing SMH's 12-day EMA against its 26-day EMA. A bearish crossover (EMA12 below EMA26) signals deteriorating semiconductor momentum within an otherwise bullish broader market. In this state, the strategy checks SMH against its 25-day moving average: if SMH is below the 25d MA and RSI(10) is below 30, it buys SOXL (3x semiconductors) as an extreme dip-buy. If RSI is not that oversold but SMH is still below the 25d MA, it holds SMH. If SMH is above the 25d MA despite the bearish MACD crossover, it holds 50% SHY (short-term treasuries) and 50% SMH as a partial defensive hedge.",
      "When SMH's MACD is bullish (EMA12 above EMA26) and the broader market is in an uptrend, the strategy enters its most aggressive mode: a momentum filter selects the top 3 performers by 90-day moving average of returns from a hand-curated universe of 19 major semiconductor companies, NVDA, TSM, AVGO, ASML, TXN, QCOM, AMD, INTC, ADI, AMAT, MU, LRCX, SNPS, KLAC, NXPI, MRVL, MCHP, ON, and STM, and equal-weights the three winners. In bear mode (SPY EMA8 below SMA200), the strategy uses SMH RSI(10) below 31 for a SOXL dip-buy, a relative RSI filter between SSG (2x short semis) and BSV (short bonds) when SMH is below its 25d MA, SOXS (3x short semiconductors) when SMH RSI exceeds 70 in a downtrend, or plain SMH as the default hold."

Only when the market is rising but not overheated does it run its actual thesis: hold the best three of 19 named chip companies on 90-day momentum. It is one of only four strategies here that buy individual stocks rather than funds, and its 19-name universe is by far the largest of them.",

        "Long bear markets, where the short leg gets time to work. Below the trend gate the logic ranks SSG against BSV and takes the stronger, and SSG compounded +125.2% across the 129 days it was named. Through the 2022 decline the reconstruction held SSG on 42% of days while SSG rose 119.6%.",

The trend-following strategies reviewed alongside it hold exactly one fund on every single day of their records.",
        "**Turnover is high for a strategy described as a sector specialist.** 1,229 allocation changes across {backtest_days} days is about one every three trading days, and none of the figures on this page carries a commission, a spread or a slippage assumption.",

      "This is a multi-component, equal-weight strategy that runs several market-cycle systems in parallel: a SPY 200-day trend engine with 5-ETF momentum selection, a shorter-term TQQQ 20-day component, and a secondary SPY regime component, all sharing dual UVXY overbought guards and a cascading bear-market protocol that includes dip-buying, deep-bear routing, and a QQQ cumulative-return detector. Equal-weighting independent sub-strategies is a diversification technique: each 'horseman' captures a different timeframe or signal, and blending them smooths the combined equity curve.",
      "Across roughly 14 years it returns {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized with a strong {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and {calmar_ratio} Calmar against a {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown and {standard_deviation:0} volatility. The combination of a long backtest, parallel-system diversification, and layered bear protocols gives it one of the more robust risk-adjusted profiles among the original (non-zoop) strategies. The cost is complexity, since many interacting components are harder to audit and carry more parameter risk, but the multi-system design is a deliberate hedge against any single signal failing."

    "how_it_works": [
      "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is an equal-weight portfolio of multiple parallel components, each running its own full market-cycle logic simultaneously. The dominant components use SPY's 200-day moving average as the primary regime gate. In bull mode, each shares the same overbought stack: QQQ RSI(10) above 81 OR SPY RSI(10) above 80 triggers UVXY; SPY RSI(60) above 60 triggers rotation into the best-performing defensive asset from [TMF, UUP, VIXY, XLP, VTI/SPLV, IWM, SCO] by 15-day return. When neither overbought condition is met, the bull-mode primary bet is a 21-day momentum filter selecting the top 3 of [TQQQ, SOXL, TECL, UDOW, UPRO] combined with a position in SVXY (short VIX futures, profiting from volatility premium decay in calm markets).",
      "A second parallel component tracks TQQQ's 20-day moving average rather than SPY's 200d MA, adding shorter-term regime sensitivity. When TQQQ is above its 20d MA, this component holds TQQQ outright (with the same dual UVXY overbought guards applied). When TQQQ drops below the 20d MA, it pivots: TQQQ RSI(10) below 31 selects the more oversold of TECL or SOXL by RSI(7) for a short-term tech panic dip-buy. If RSI is not extreme, it runs a relative RSI filter between TLT, PSQ, and BSV to select either a long-bond refuge or an inverse-QQQ position based on which shows stronger recent momentum.",
      "The bear-mode logic within the SPY 200d MA components is the most sophisticated element of the strategy. Beyond standard dip-buys (TQQQ RSI(10) < 31 -> TECL, SMH RSI(10) < 30 -> SOXL, SPY RSI(10) < 30 -> UPRO), the strategy activates a deep bear protocol when QQQ's 252-day cumulative return falls below -20%, confirming a major bear market rather than a correction. Within this state, it routes through QQQ vs. 20d MA position and QQQ 60-day cumulative return thresholds: a 60d loss below -12% triggers a choice between SPY (if SPY is above its 20d MA) or a TLT vs. SQQQ RSI filter for further decline; a 60d loss above -12% routes through TLT vs. SQQQ RSI for TQQQ or SQQQ. Additionally, when QQQ's 10-day cumulative return exceeds +5.5% in a bear market, the strategy positions in PSQ rather than chasing the bounce, recognizing bear market rallies as traps."

The noteworthy characteristic is that the strategy takes very large losses relative to its returns, since fading extreme single-sector moves works until a move keeps going, and 3x chip ETFs punish a wrong-way bet harshly.

The outer gate checks RSI(UVXY,30d) > 63. When UVXY's 30-day RSI is this elevated, the strategy enters 'high volatility' mode where daily magnitude triggers become active. The specific thresholds (-3%, -5.5%, -7% for down days; +3.5%, +4.5%, +5.5% for up days) represent different tiers of 'pop' severity, each carrying a different expected reversal profile.",
      "The '30-20-10 Double Pop' is the strategy's core signal system. After a significant single-day move, it evaluates SMH's RSI across three decreasing windows: 30-day, 20-day, and 10-day. Thresholds escalate tighter at shorter windows (RSI > 70 at 30d, > 75 at 20d, > 80 at 10d). If any threshold is breached, the strategy holds SOXS, betting that a recent extreme pop is about to fade. RSI(SMH,10d) < 30 inverts the logic and triggers a SOXL buy for extreme oversold conditions. If no RSI threshold fires, the strategy uses SPY RSI(60d) > 50 and a bond-market check (RSI(IEF,200d) vs TLT) to route into either the 'Double Pop Bot' component or the 'SOXL FTLT' component.",
      "The 'SOXL FTLT' (For The Long Term) sub-component is an embedded longer-term fallback that runs when no short-term mean-reversion signal is active. It checks MaxDD(SPY,10d) > 6 (recent drawdown exceeding 6%) to classify the immediate market environment as bear or bull, then uses CumRet(SVXY,5d) > 0 and RSI(TQQQ,60d) > 50 to select between SOXL and BSV via a momentum filter. In plain terms: when the semiconductor pop system gives no strong signal, the strategy defaults to a SPY/SVXY/TQQQ-based momentum classifier. The max drawdown, among the deepest in the library, reflects SOXL's inherent volatility and the strategy's willingness to maintain long semiconductor exposure even through major semiconductor bear markets."

The hyper-precise, oddly specific numeric thresholds betray its algorithmic origin: rather than round human-chosen levels, the boundaries were fitted by an optimization process searching for the best historical configuration.",
      "It returns {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized over a long 15-year backtest but carries the deepest drawdown in the entire library at {max_drawdown_abs:0}, with extreme {standard_deviation:0} volatility and weak {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and {calmar_ratio} Calmar ratios. Two cautions dominate. First, an {max_drawdown_abs:0} drawdown means the strategy lost nearly nine-tenths of peak value at its worst, which few investors could hold through. Second, RL and optimized strategies are especially prone to overfitting, because thresholds tuned to maximize a past backtest often degrade out-of-sample. The long test window helps, but the algorithmic curve-fitting risk and catastrophic drawdown are the headline concerns."

      "SOXL Growth v2.4.5 RL takes its name from its generation method: 'RL' indicates Reinforcement Learning, a machine-learning technique where an agent learns optimal decisions through trial and reward signals on historical data. The tell is in the thresholds, human-designed strategies use round numbers (RSI > 50, drawdown > 50%), while RL-optimized strategies produce values like RSI(SOXL,32d) <= 62.1995, StdDev(SOXL,105d) <= 4.9226, and RSI(SOXL,30d) >= 57.49. These precise decimals are the fingerprints of an optimizer that tested thousands of parameter combinations. The strategy integrates two categories of signals most strategies ignore: standard deviation of returns (volatility-of-volatility) and maximum drawdown thresholds on the instruments themselves.",
      "The outer gate uses MaxDD(SOXL,60d) >= 50: if SOXL has experienced a 50% or greater drawdown within the last 60 trading days, the strategy enters its 'major drawdown' branch. In this branch, the primary reference switches from SOXL to TQQQ: it checks StdDev(TQQQ,14d) and StdDev(TQQQ,100d) to classify short-term and long-term volatility. Low volatility on both timeframes suggests a potential recovery, routing into [SOXL, TQQQ, SPXL] momentum filter. High short-term volatility but positive RSI(TQQQ,30d) routes to SPXL or SOXS depending on recent vol. A CumRet(TQQQ,8d) <= -20 check catches 8-day crash scenarios and re-enters SOXL as a dip-buy. MaxDD(TQQQ,200d) <= 65 triggers the inverse basket [TMV, SQQQ, SPXS].",
      "When SOXL has NOT experienced a 50%+ drawdown in 60 days (normal regime), the strategy routes through RSI(SOXL,32d) <= 62.2 as a secondary gate. In the RSI-below-threshold path, it checks long-term volatility (StdDev(SOXL,105d) <= 4.92), low long-term vol just holds SOXL outright. Higher long-term vol activates RSI(SOXL,30d) >= 57.49 and StdDev(SOXL,30d) >= 5.41 for current-month assessment: a combination of elevated 30d RSI and high 30d volatility leads to SOXS, otherwise to [SOXL, SPXL, TQQQ] filter. The deep drawdown check CumRet(SOXL,32d) <= -12 re-enters SOXL on a 32-day crash. The max drawdown, the deepest in this library, reflects the strategy's commitment to SOXL even in bear markets, with inverse ETF positions providing only periodic protection."

      "Named after the well-publicized chip-stock trading, this is a semiconductor mean-reversion strategy that uses 5-day SOXX cumulative returns to detect weekly momentum extremes, then trades SOXL or SOXS at the reversal point, while applying individual RSI checks on NVDA and AMD to catch extreme overbought and oversold conditions in the two bellwether names. The thesis is short-horizon reversion in chips: fade weekly extremes and lean on the most influential individual stocks to confirm the turn.",
      "This is the weakest risk-adjusted profile in the library, and its metrics should be read as a cautionary example: {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized over roughly 14 years, but an {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown, the second deepest here behind SOXL Growth (Original), with a {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and a Calmar of just {calmar_ratio}, meaning the annualized return is actually smaller than the maximum loss endured to earn it. Fading single-sector momentum without a strong regime gate exposes it to ruinous trends where the 'extreme' keeps extending. The long backtest only underscores that the poor ratios are structural, not a small-sample artifact; this strategy illustrates how high single-sector leverage can produce large returns and unacceptable risk simultaneously."

    "how_it_works": [
      "Inside Nancy Pelosi's Chips - V3 is named after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose family made large and well-timed trades in semiconductor stocks including NVDA and AVGO during the period when the CHIPS and Science Act (2022) was being debated and signed into law. The strategy's name is an editorial comment on the information advantage that public officials might have in chip-sector legislative timing. The strategy itself uses purely technical signals, no news or legislative calendars, but focuses exclusively on the same semiconductor universe that made Pelosi's trades famous.",
      "The primary logic is a 5-day return mean-reversion framework on SOXX. When SOXX has gained more than 5% in the past five trading days (a strong week), the strategy checks whether today's 1-day return is sharply down (CumRet(SOXX,1d) < -2): if yes, it buys SOXL on the pullback within the strong week, betting the uptrend continues. If the day is not sharply down, it holds SOXS, betting the strong week has already over-extended. The mirror logic applies in the bearish case: CumRet(SOXX,5d) < -5 (weak week) with a positive day (> 2%) triggers SOXS (fading the dead-cat bounce), while a flat or down day triggers SOXL as a continuation dip-buy.",
      "In the normal regime (no extreme 5-day SOXX move), the strategy splits into two co-equal 50% sleeves, one driven by NVDA's individual RSI and one by AMD's, each using very tight thresholds. In each sleeve, RSI(8d) > 90 is an extreme overbought signal (only fires when the stock has gained unusually sharply over eight days) and holds SOXS, while RSI(3d) < 15 is extreme oversold (a severe short-term crash) and holds SOXL. Because the two sleeves are independent, they can disagree, blending to a mixed net position. When neither extreme fires in a sleeve, it uses a SOXX EMA trend cross: if SOXX's 10-day EMA is above its 200-day EMA (sector trending up), it runs a momentum filter that picks the single top 90-day-return name from [SOXX, NVDA, AMD, XLE, ENPH]; if the 10-day EMA is below the 200-day EMA (downtrend), it rotates defensively to the top two 90-day-return names from [SPY, DBC, XLE]."

      "This is a clean three-branch strategy gated by SPY's extreme short-term RSI. When SPY is extremely overbought it rotates into a UVXY volatility hedge; when extremely oversold it attacks with leveraged ETFs; and in the normal middle state it runs momentum selection from a curated mega-cap basket spanning value, growth, and crypto-proxy names. The structure is intuitive (hedge the froth, buy the panic, and otherwise own the strongest large caps) which keeps it far more legible than the deeply nested semiconductor strategies.",
      "Over an 11-year backtest it returns {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized with a {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe, {calmar_ratio} Calmar, and a {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown. The notable risk is that drawdown: despite using only RSI and momentum, the leveraged-attack branch and high-beta mega-cap basket still produce deep losses in severe selloffs. Its appeal is simplicity and breadth, a transparent rule set over a diversified large-cap universe, for an investor who wants clear logic and accepts aggressive drawdowns."

    "how_it_works": [
      "Top Cap by MA + RSI ETF Hedge uses SPY's 6-day RSI as a binary traffic light that routes 100% of the portfolio into one of three distinct modes. The RSI window is unusually short, most strategies in this library use 10-day RSI. A 6-day RSI is more sensitive and therefore more selective: it reaches extreme readings (above 90 or below 28) only during very sharp short-term moves, not routine trending action. The 90 and 28 thresholds are also more extreme than the 79-80 / 30-31 used by most comparable strategies, meaning the hedge and leveraged-attack modes fire infrequently. The vast majority of trading days fall into the normal regime and route to the mega-cap stock basket.",
      "When SPY RSI(6d) >= 90, the portfolio rotates entirely to UVXY. This is an extreme overbought hedge: a 6-day RSI of 90 in SPY indicates SPY has moved almost continuously upward for 6 days, a condition historically followed by short-term pullbacks. UVXY (a leveraged long VIX-futures ETF) benefits from both the volatility spike and the reversal momentum. When SPY RSI(6d) <= 28, the strategy swings to its most aggressive allocation: from the leveraged attack basket [TQQQ, LABU, SPXL] it buys the single worst 5-day performer, a mean-reversion bounce play. A 6-day RSI of 28 in SPY means the market has fallen almost uninterrupted for 6 days, which often precedes a sharp relief bounce, precisely when holding 3x leveraged long positions offers the highest risk/reward.",
      "The default regime holds a momentum filter from the mega-cap stock universe: WMT (Walmart), MSTR (MicroStrategy, a Bitcoin treasury company), AMZN (Amazon), KO (Coca-Cola), BRK/B (Berkshire Hathaway Class B), AAPL (Apple), and TSLA (Tesla). This basket spans defensive value names (WMT, KO, BRK/B), mega-cap growth (AMZN, AAPL, TSLA), and a crypto proxy (MSTR). The filter selects the top performer by recent momentum, concentrating the position in whichever of these names is currently leading. This creates an unusual hybrid strategy: highly speculative leveraged ETFs at extremes, conservative mega-caps as the baseline."

The entire decision tree consists of four leaves: UVXY, TQQQ, SPY, or TQQQ (repeated in bear mode).

This is identical to the logic used by Holy Grail, TQQQ For The Long Term, and The Four Horsemen, the 79 threshold on TQQQ 10d RSI is a standard overbought trigger used across multiple strategies. If RSI is not elevated, the strategy holds TQQQ for the leveraged bull-market upside.",

Rather than activating dip-buying on TECL or SOXL, or running a momentum filter between SQQQ and TLT, this strategy simply checks whether TQQQ RSI(10d) > 79. If overbought even in a bear market, it holds SPY outright (not UVXY, the bear-mode overbought response is a downgrade to unlevered equity, not a volatility bet). If RSI is not elevated in bear mode, the strategy holds TQQQ.

A 'VIXM Black Swan Catcher' holds mid-term VIX futures when volatility has been persistently elevated, providing a crisis hedge, while a multi-sector momentum rotator selects the single best performer from a diversified pool spanning semiconductor leaders, the broad market, energy, commodities, and clean energy. The combination pairs a tail-risk hedge with a breadth-seeking momentum engine, so the strategy aims to rotate into whatever sector is leading while holding insurance for volatility spikes.",
      "Over roughly 14 years it returns {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized with a modest {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe, a {calmar_ratio} Calmar, and a deep {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown. The weak Calmar signals the core issue: the sector-momentum sleeve still suffers large drawdowns, and the VIXM hedge, which bleeds during calm markets, drags on returns more than it protects in this configuration. The diversified sector universe is genuinely broad, but the metrics suggest the hedge-plus-rotation balance is not well tuned; it is a moderate strategy whose risk outweighs its return relative to the leveraged peers here."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "SPY, Energy, Chips, Commodities (originally named with a black swan emoji '🦢' to signal its tail-risk awareness) runs two parallel components. The first is a 'Black Swan Catcher' that watches RSI(VIXM,40d) > 69. VIXM (ProShares VIX Mid-Term Futures ETF) tracks 4-7 month VIX futures rather than the 1-month futures tracked by VXX or the 2x daily version tracked by UVXY. Mid-term VIX moves more slowly and decays less aggressively from contango, making it a more sustainable fear hedge. A 40-day RSI of 69 in VIXM means volatility has been persistently elevated for over a month, this is not a daily spike signal but a sustained-fear detector.",
      "When the Black Swan Catcher is not triggered (RSI(VIXM,40d) <= 69), the entire portfolio falls to the second component: a momentum rotator across [SOXX, NVDA, AMD, SPY, DBC, XLE, ENPH]. This universe deliberately diversifies across uncorrelated sectors: SOXX (semiconductor ETF), NVDA and AMD (individual chip leaders), SPY (broad US equities), DBC (diversified commodity index), XLE (energy sector), and ENPH (Enphase Energy, solar/clean energy). The rotator selects the top performer by recent momentum, whichever asset has shown the strongest trend, and concentrates the full portfolio there. The strategy never holds multiple assets simultaneously in the rotation mode.",
      "The logic encodes a macro view: semiconductors and AI-adjacent companies (SOXX, NVDA, AMD), commodities and energy (DBC, XLE), and clean energy (ENPH) represent the three major secular growth themes of the 2010s-2020s. SPY serves as the benchmark safety net when no sector theme is outperforming. The Black Swan Catcher layer provides protection that the rotation cannot offer, when markets are in a sustained panic (not a single-day spike), VIXM will have persistently elevated RSI and the strategy parks there rather than chasing a collapsing sector. This differs from strategies that use instantaneous RSI(10d) spikes: the 40-day RSI of VIXM measures weeks of sustained fear, not a single day."

Thresholds range from 75 (XLP) to 80 (XLY, FAS, SPY), with most set at 79. If any single ticker crosses its threshold, 100% of the portfolio rotates to UVXY (a leveraged long VIX-futures ETF). The strategy treats any overbought sector as a systemic early warning, one hot ticker is enough to go defensive. This makes Simon's KMLM Switcher unusual: most strategies rely on 1-2 overbought signals, while this strategy checks 11 in parallel, dramatically increasing the frequency of UVXY rotations.",
      "When none of the 11 overbought conditions fire, the strategy cascades through four dip-buy checks on leveraged ETFs: TQQQ RSI(10) < 30 buys TECL (3x tech), SOXL RSI(10) < 30 buys SOXL, SPXL RSI(10) < 30 buys SPXL, and LABU RSI(10) < 25 buys LABU. These are strict oversold thresholds designed to catch 3x ETF capitulation events, moments when a leveraged instrument has fallen so sharply that RSI reaches extreme lows. Note the first branch reads TQQQ's oversold signal but expresses the trade through TECL rather than TQQQ itself; the remaining three buy the same ETF they measure. Each condition is checked in order; the first one that triggers takes 100% of the portfolio. The LABU threshold of 25 is tighter than the others, reflecting biotech's extreme volatility. This layer only activates in specific crash conditions, when a leveraged ETF is genuinely at panic-sell levels, and not during ordinary pullbacks.",
      "If neither the overbought layer nor the dip-buy layer fires, the strategy's core logic activates: comparing RSI(10) of XLK (iShares US Technology ETF) versus RSI(10) of KMLM (KFA Mount Lucas Managed Futures Index Strategy ETF). When XLK's RSI exceeds KMLM's, tech showing stronger short-term momentum than managed futures, the strategy selects the bottom two performers by RSI(10) from the trio {TECL, SOXL, SVIX (-1x Short VIX Futures)}, equal-weighting them. This is a mean-reversion bet in the most beaten-up leveraged assets during a tech-momentum environment. When KMLM's RSI exceeds XLK's, managed futures outperforming tech, typically a risk-off or trending market signal, the portfolio rotates entirely to whichever of SQQQ (3x inverse QQQ) or TLT (20+ year treasuries) has the higher RSI(10), placing the full portfolio in a defensive or bearish position."

      "This strategy is built on a counterintuitive premise: when bonds (BND) are outperforming high-beta equities (SPHB) on a 10-day RSI basis, the strategy buys SOXL (3x semiconductors), the riskiest holding in this library. The logic inverts conventional risk-on thinking. BND momentum exceeding SPHB momentum signals a short-term risk-off sentiment extreme, which the strategy reads as a setup for a sharp reversal in speculative assets. The position is binary: fully in SOXL or fully in SHV (cash), with UVXY RSI tiers providing a separate volatility-based crash guard that can redirect to cash or SOXL depending on implied volatility conditions.",
      "Over approximately 14.7 years, the strategy posts {annualized_rate_of_return} annualized returns with a {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown, one of the deepest in this library. The backtest begins around May 2011 when SPHB launched, so it excludes both the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bust, two periods that would almost certainly produce larger drawdowns. The 100x+ returns are compelling but the {max_drawdown_abs:0} drawdown and the extreme SOXL concentration are the defining risk characteristics. This suits only investors who can accept losing most of their portfolio value mid-cycle while trusting that a relative RSI signal between bonds and high-beta stocks is a durable edge in semiconductors."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "The strategy's central signal compares the 10-day RSI of BND (Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF) versus SPHB (Invesco S&P 500 High Beta ETF), two proxies at opposite ends of the risk spectrum. When BND's 10-day RSI exceeds SPHB's, the strategy interprets this as a short-term risk-off signal and takes its most aggressive position: holding SOXL (3x leveraged semiconductors). The rationale is mean-reversion. Defensive assets outperforming aggressive ones on a 10-day basis often signals a temporary sentiment extreme, and the leveraged semiconductor position profits from the eventual rotation back to risk-on. The inverse also holds: when SPHB RSI exceeds BND RSI (risk-on environment), the strategy defaults to SHV (near cash), treating high-beta outperformance as a sign the rally may be overextended.",
      "Within the bond-leading regime (BND RSI > SPHB RSI), two sequential conditions refine the default SOXL position. First, if SOXX RSI(10) exceeds 80 (semiconductors overbought despite broad defensiveness), the strategy rotates to SHV to avoid a blow-off top entry. Second, if SOXX is not overbought, the strategy checks UVXY RSI(10) as a volatility gauge. A reading above 84 (extreme panic) triggers an unconditional SOXL buy. Between 74 and 84 (elevated volatility), SOXL is only bought if its own RSI(10) is below 30 (doubly confirmed oversold); otherwise the strategy holds SHV. If UVXY RSI is below 74 (calm market), the strategy simply holds SOXL as the default bond-leading position with no fear signal required.",
      "The risk-on branch (SPHB RSI > BND RSI) is simpler: the only exception to holding SHV is if SOXL RSI(10) falls below 30, which overrides the risk-on signal with a dip-buy. Outside that extreme, the strategy sits in cash when the market is broadly bullish and risk-seeking. This design, holding SOXL when the market is defensive and holding cash when the market is euphoric, makes 10d BND vs. 10d SPHB a high-patience, high-conviction contrarian strategy. SPHB launched in May 2011, which anchors the backtest start date and prevents testing through the 2008 financial crisis or the dot-com bust."

      "Dip Buying Tech is explicitly designed as a backtesting study and educational baseline, not a live portfolio strategy. The author built it to test whether a simple two-signal decision tree (a 200-day moving average trend gate plus a single oversold trigger) could survive the dot-com crash, which the 27.2-year backtest window starting April 1999 directly validates. The logic is three branches: hold SPY in bull markets, retreat to XLP consumer staples as the defensive base in bear markets, and dip-buy XLK technology when QQQ's 10-day RSI falls below 30. No leverage, no exotic tickers, nothing hidden.",
      "The {annualized_rate_of_return} annualized return is modest but represents 27-plus years of live-through-it performance including two major crashes and a rate shock, all with a {max_drawdown_abs} max drawdown. Its value is conceptual: it demonstrates that even the simplest possible regime-plus-oversold structure can outperform passive SPY over the long run without leverage. The strategy is intentionally simple enough to explain in one sentence, making it the clearest possible baseline for understanding how more complex strategies in this library build on the same two-signal foundation."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "Dip Buying Tech is one of the simplest strategies in this library: a three-leaf decision tree with a single trend gate and one dip-buy signal. In bull mode, when SPY's current price is above its 200-day simple moving average, the strategy holds SPY outright with 100% allocation. No overbought guards, no leveraged ETFs, no momentum filters. The full Composer name makes the educational intent explicit: 'Dip Buying Tech Below 10d RSI of 30 using XLP as the cash position and XLK as the tech ETF to backtest through the dot com crash.' The strategy was designed as a transparent baseline to test whether adding a single tech dip-buy signal to a SPY 200d MA framework meaningfully improves returns over a 27-year window that includes two catastrophic bear markets.",
      "When SPY crosses below its 200-day moving average, the strategy enters bear mode and shifts to XLP (Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund) as its default holding. Consumer staples companies generate steady revenues across economic cycles, making XLP one of the most reliable defensive sector rotations. The strategy uses XLP rather than cash or bonds because the 1999 backtest start date predates many bond ETFs, and because XLP provides equity-like returns during mild bear markets while limiting catastrophic losses during severe ones. XLP is essentially the strategy's low-volatility parking position between dip-buy entries.",
      "The one active signal in bear mode is a QQQ RSI dip-buy: when QQQ's 10-day RSI falls below 30, the strategy rotates from XLP to XLK (Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund). A QQQ RSI(10) below 30 requires a sustained sharp decline in the Nasdaq 100, not a single bad day. During bear markets, tech often leads the decline; when RSI hits extreme oversold levels, the strategy bets on a mean-reversion bounce and positions in the unleveraged XLK. The use of XLK over TQQQ or TECL keeps the risk profile conservative even at the dip-buy entry. When QQQ RSI recovers above 30, the strategy returns to XLP until SPY reclaims its 200d moving average."

      "Ob Os Staple my Bonds V0.0 is the original baseline of a multi-version strategy series. The name decodes as Overbought/Oversold (Ob/Os) plus Staples (XLP) plus Bonds (VBF). The core logic is continuous relative-value rotation between two defensive assets: whichever of XLP (consumer staples) and VBF (Invesco Bond Fund) currently has the lower 10-day RSI receives the full allocation. This treats RSI as a relative beaten-down signal rather than an absolute threshold, rotating toward whichever defensive asset has been sold down more recently. The single offensive override fires when QQQ's RSI(10) falls to or below 30, rotating the entire portfolio to unleveraged QQQ for a mean-reversion dip-buy.",
      "The result is one of the most conservative profiles in this library: {annualized_rate_of_return} annualized with a {max_drawdown_abs} max drawdown across 27.2 years including the dot-com crash, 2008 financial crisis, and 2022 rate shock. That combination of steady compounding and low drawdown reflects what a strategy looks like when its default state is always in something defensive. The V0.0 designation means this page covers only the 1999-start original; the author notes later versions (V0.1 through V0.3) use progressively shorter backtest windows, which typically improves reported metrics. This version is best understood as a long-run reference for defensive RSI rotation behavior across full market cycles."

    "how_it_works": [
      "Ob Os Staple my Bonds V0.0 is the original baseline of a multi-version strategy series. The name decodes as Overbought/Oversold (Ob/Os) + Staples (XLP) + Bonds (VBF). The strategy operates on a single oversold threshold: when QQQ's 10-day RSI falls to or below 30, it exits its defensive position and buys QQQ outright. A QQQ RSI(10) at or below 30 signals a sustained sharp Nasdaq decline, and the strategy enters expecting a mean-reversion bounce. Unlike most strategies in this library that use leveraged ETFs (TQQQ, TECL, SOXL) for dip-buying, V0.0 holds unleveraged QQQ, reflecting both its 1999 origin date when 3x ETFs did not yet exist and its conservative design philosophy.",
      "When QQQ is not in extreme oversold territory, the strategy runs a two-asset competition between XLP (Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund) and VBF (Invesco Bond Fund, an actively managed bond fund). It evaluates the 10-day RSI of both and holds whichever has the lower reading, always rotating to the more beaten-up of the two. If XLP has been selling off while VBF has been rising, the strategy holds XLP. If VBF has been declining while staples hold steady, it moves to VBF. The result is a defensive portfolio that continuously tilts toward the asset experiencing more near-term stress, applying mean-reversion logic within an already-conservative two-asset universe.",
      "The multi-version series (V0.0 from 1999, V0.1 from 2007, V0.2 from 2010, V0.3 from 2011) stress-tests the same logic across different market eras. V0.0 is the most demanding test, covering both the dot-com crash (Nasdaq fell 78% from 2000 to 2002) and the 2008 financial crisis. The lowest max drawdown in this library, earned since 1999 despite those two historic bear markets, reflects the protective power of the XLP/VBF defensive default and the QQQ dip-buy's discipline in waiting for RSI(10) <= 30 before entering. VBF (Invesco Bond Fund) is an actively managed bond fund, distinct from passive ETFs like BND or TLT, and its inclusion reflects the instruments available at the 1999 backtest start date."

These priority gates can fire regardless of the broader market regime. After the priority checks clear, the strategy routes through five sub-regimes: Choppy, Bull 1, Bull 2, Bear 1, and Bear 2, each deciding whether TQQQ exposure is warranted based on layered bond-versus-equity momentum signals, ultimately choosing between TQQQ, various leveraged alternatives, and defensive positions.",
      "Over approximately 14.7 years the strategy posts {annualized_rate_of_return} annualized returns and a roughly 1.9 billion times cumulative return, among the highest backtest figures in this library, with a {max_drawdown_abs} max drawdown that is large in absolute terms but notably restrained relative to those headline numbers. The backtest starts around October 2011 when UVXY launched, excluding 2008 and the early stages of the 2010 flash crash. The {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and {calmar_ratio} Calmar are exceptional by any standard. The five-regime depth and the priority-gate architecture are the distinguishing design features: the strategy is not 'always TQQQ' or 'sometimes TQQQ based on one signal' but a carefully sequenced decision tree that treats TQQQ as the preferred outcome and routes away from it only under explicit disqualifying conditions."

      "'Sometimes TQQQ' describes the strategy's core design principle: TQQQ (3x Nasdaq 100) is the preferred holding, but only under specific conditions, hence 'sometimes.' Two priority checks run before any regime analysis. If QQQ's 10-day RSI falls below 32, the strategy immediately rotates to TECL (3x technology sector ETF), entering tech recoveries slightly above the classic 30 threshold for earlier positioning. If QQQ is not that oversold but SPY's 10-day RSI falls below 30 (a broader market capitulation signal), it rotates to UPRO (3x S&P 500). These two dip-buy gates are unconditional: they fire regardless of what the SPY 200-day moving average or any other regime signal says. Their counterparts at the upper end of the RSI range are overbought exits: if QQQ RSI(10) exceeds 81 or SPY RSI(10) exceeds 80, the strategy buys UVXY (1.5x long VIX futures) as an overbought hedge, converting extreme RSI readings into volatility-long positions.",
      "If no RSI extreme is active and SPY is above its simple moving average (bull market), the strategy enters one of three bull sub-regimes. A 60-day SPY RSI reading above 61 signals an extended or choppy bull market, routing to a sub-strategy that compares QQQ's 100-day RSI against VPU (Vanguard Utilities ETF) and uses CORP vs. BIL cumulative returns to choose between UPRO, SPY, SH (1x inverse S&P), or BIL. When the 60-day SPY RSI is below 61 (healthy trend pace), the strategy further splits on TLT vs. PSQ RSI: if TLT RSI is below PSQ RSI, it enters the Bull 1 sub-strategy; otherwise Bull 2. Both sub-strategies target TQQQ as the primary holding, using layered cumulative return comparisons (60-day BND vs. BIL, BND vs. SH RSI, BND vs. QQQ RSI) to confirm bond conditions support staying long 3x Nasdaq, and routing to PSQ (1x inverse Nasdaq), GLD, or SQQQ (3x inverse) when they do not.",
      "When SPY falls below its moving average (bear market), the strategy routes into one of two bear sub-strategies. If QQQ has lost more than 12% over 60 days (Bear 1, deep bear), it distinguishes between a mature bear (QQQ down 20%+ over 252 days, suggesting capitulation near) and an ongoing decline, using QQQ's 20-day moving average plus TLT-vs-SQQQ RSI and 10-day bounce detection to choose between unleveraged QQQ, TQQQ dip-buys, and SQQQ. In the shallower bear (Bear 2, QQQ down less than 12% over 60 days), TQQQ's own moving average becomes the key gate: above it the strategy seeks exposure through TQQQ or SQQQ based on bond strength; below it the strategy rotates to GLD or SQQQ based on IEF vs. PSQ momentum. The layered architecture means the strategy almost always has a directional opinion rather than defaulting to cash."

      "Triple Accelerator is authored by Inverteum Capital as a minimal but purposeful rotation across three assets: TQQQ, SPY and UVXY. The backtest begins around October 2011, coinciding with UVXY's inception. Its Sharpe and Calmar reflect a strategy that earns strong returns by staying leveraged through bull markets while managing the two main failure modes of 3x leverage: overbought reversals and trend deterioration.",
      "The architecture is deliberately simple: a single TQQQ RSI(10) check runs first -- if RSI exceeds 79, the strategy rotates to UVXY as a volatility hedge against an overbought market. If not, an SPY 200-day moving average gate decides the allocation: TQQQ during confirmed uptrends, unleveraged SPY during downtrends. The result is a three-state machine with about 12.6 annual portfolio switches (annualized turnover). The roughly 56% win rate and right-skewed return distribution (skewness 1.14, max single-day gain of 50.0%) suggest a strategy that captures large upside days while the MA gate limits prolonged drawdown exposure."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "Triple Accelerator uses a two-gate decision tree evaluated top-down. The first gate checks TQQQ's 10-day RSI: if it exceeds 79, the strategy allocates entirely to UVXY, a leveraged long VIX-futures ETF. This overbought hedge runs unconditionally before any trend analysis, which means the strategy can hold UVXY even in a nominal bull market when leveraged tech has become technically extreme. The intuition is that when TQQQ RSI(10) is above 79 the market has been rising hard, mean-reversion risk is elevated, and a volatility spike from a sudden reversal is the most likely near-term scenario -- UVXY profits from exactly that.",
      "If the RSI overbought condition is not active, the strategy falls through to the second gate: SPY's current price versus its 200-day simple moving average. Above the moving average (confirmed uptrend), the strategy allocates 100% to TQQQ for maximum leveraged upside in Nasdaq. Below the moving average (downtrend), it rotates to unleveraged SPY rather than going to cash or inverse ETFs, preserving equity exposure while eliminating 3x leverage risk during bear markets. The three resulting states -- UVXY at RSI extremes, TQQQ in bull trends, SPY in bear trends -- cover the full regime space with no overlapping conditions and no default-to-cash dead zones."

      "The Gold Miner (Original) is plaindamnscared's original Gold Miner algorithm with one change: BIL (cash) is replaced by GLD (physical gold) as the defensive holding. The backtest begins in March 2021, when GDXU and GDXD launched. Its exceptional Calmar reflects a period dominated by a powerful gold bull market, and the trailing one-year return shows how violently the gold miner sector has re-rated in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The architecture is a four-state machine built around GDXU's RSI. Two priority gates handle extremes: RSI(10) above 79 routes to GDXD (inverse miners, fade the overbought spike), RSI(10) below 30 routes to GDXU (leveraged miners, buy the dip). Between those extremes, two momentum comparisons determine whether to hold GDXU or GLD. The highest annualized standard deviation in this library and a high annual turnover reflect the leveraged 3x miner ETFs at the core; this is an aggressive sector strategy, not a diversified portfolio."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "The strategy uses GDXU's own RSI as its primary signal, evaluating two extremes before consulting any broader market context. If GDXU's 10-day RSI exceeds 79, the strategy immediately rotates to GDXD (a 3x inverse gold miners ETF), treating the overbought reading as a mean-reversion signal. If GDXU's RSI drops below 30, it rotates into GDXU directly as an oversold dip-buy. These two gates fire unconditionally, bypassing all other checks.",
      "When RSI is between 30 and 79, the strategy uses two cumulative return comparisons to route between GDXU and GLD. The first checks whether QQQ's 90-day return exceeds its 70-day return, which signals that the equity trend has been building for a sustained period. If true, a second check compares GDXU's 70-day return against its 75-day return: if the shorter window is lagging (recent momentum fading), it holds GDXU expecting a continuation; if the shorter window is ahead (momentum strong), it rotates to GLD. If QQQ's 90-day return does not exceed its 70-day return, the strategy checks whether TLT's 95-day return is less than QQQ's 35-day return: if bonds are losing to short-term equity momentum, it holds GDXD; otherwise it holds GLD. The result is that GLD acts as a refuge during ambiguous momentum conditions rather than cash, keeping some exposure to gold's safe-haven demand even when the leveraged miner case is unclear."

      "TQQQ or Not is the seed of a large family of hold-3x-Nasdaq-but-only-when-conditions-allow strategies, and this is its original long-history build (source name 'TQQQ or not/Pop'). It is not a single default-plus-overrides rule but a small ensemble. One gate sits on top: a fast TQQQ RSI(10) above 79 is read as overbought and puts the whole book in UVXY. Below that gate the portfolio splits 50/50 into two sleeves that run at the same time. The first, 'BlackSwan MeanRev BondSignal', holds TQQQ in a normal market but steps to cash or a volatility pop when a six-day TQQQ crash beyond -12%, a QQQ or TMF drawdown, or a bond-versus-equity regime read says conditions are hostile. The second, 'Pop', is a set of RSI pop-bots across QQQ, SMH and SPY that go long leveraged funds when they are oversold, short them or buy UVXY when overbought, and hold cash otherwise, with a VIXM volatility read switching between a defensive tiered version and a more aggressive one.",
      "Over a long, multi-cycle backtest that begins around 2011 it compounds at about {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized with a {max_drawdown_abs} max drawdown, a {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and a {calmar_ratio} Calmar. That drawdown is notably shallow for a strategy whose upside comes from 3x ETFs, which is the whole appeal of being in TQQQ sometimes rather than always: the overbought fade and the crash and pop gates take it out of the way of the worst leveraged declines. The trade-off is complexity. Many interacting RSI, cumulative-return and cross-asset thresholds fit the historical record more tightly than a single rule would, so some of the backtest polish should be read as parameter tuning rather than durable edge."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "The held universe is small: TQQQ, SPXL and SOXL (leveraged long tech, S&P and semis), SQQQ and SOXS (leveraged inverse), UVXY (volatility) and BIL (cash). One gate sits above everything: if TQQQ's 10-day RSI is above 79, the entire portfolio holds UVXY, treating a fast overbought reading as a pullback setup. When that gate is not triggered, the book is an equal-weight 50/50 blend of two sleeves that are evaluated independently, so on a typical day it can hold a mix such as half TQQQ and half cash. BND, SPY, IEF, TLT, QQQ, SMH, VIXM and TMF are used only as signals, never held.",
      "The first sleeve, 'BlackSwan MeanRev BondSignal', holds TQQQ unless something is wrong. If TQQQ's six-day cumulative return is below -12% it looks for a violent one-day rebound above 5.5% to capture in UVXY, and otherwise runs a small mean-reversion check that keeps TQQQ while it is deeply oversold (RSI(10) below 32) or while TMF's 10-day drawdown is contained, dropping to cash (BIL) if not. In a normal market it holds TQQQ only when QQQ is above its 25-day average and neither QQQ nor TMF is in a drawdown; when QQQ is below that average it defers to a bond-versus-equity regime read (a 60-day SPY RSI, BND versus SPY RSI, and IEF versus TLT RSI) that keeps TQQQ only if bonds are not clearly leading, and sits in cash otherwise.",
      "The second sleeve, 'Pop', is a set of RSI 'pop-bots'. A VIXM 10-day RSI above 70 switches it into a defensive '321 Pop' blend that runs three RSI tiers (10, 20 and 30-day) on both QQQ and SMH, going short (SQQQ or SOXS) when a tier is overbought, long leverage (TQQQ or SOXL) when it is oversold, and cash otherwise. Below that VIXM level it runs 'Pop Bot' and 'Double Popped' groups on TQQQ, SPXL, SOXL and SPY that fade overbought readings into UVXY, dip-buy oversold leverage, and confirm longs against the same 60-day SPY RSI and bond-versus-equity checks before holding TQQQ or falling back to cash. Because both sleeves and the 321 tiers are blended, the strategy frequently holds several positions at once rather than a single name."

    "description": "The original Beta Baller + TCCC build, one of the most-forked names in the Composer community, with roughly 200 symphonies in the database sharing the Beta Baller name. It is a large, daily-rebalanced regime-switching machine trading a 33-instrument universe of leveraged, inverse, bond, commodity, currency and volatility ETFs, leaning more on buy-the-dip mean reversion in leveraged funds than on momentum, with layered trend, interest-rate and volatility gates that pull it toward defense when conditions turn. Best treated as a showcase of how far community regime-switching can be pushed, not a set-and-forget allocation.",

      "Strip away the complexity and Beta Ballers is mostly a buy-the-dip bet on leveraged funds: when a high-beta ETF sells off, it tends to buy the weakest recent performer expecting a bounce, and it wraps that core idea in layers of trend, interest-rate and volatility gates that pull it into inverse funds, bonds, commodities or volatility when conditions turn hostile. Despite the aggressive name it is more mean-reversion than momentum, with more of its selection steps picking the weakest recent performer than the strongest. That same density of branches and hand-tuned thresholds is the catch, making it powerful in the conditions it was shaped around but genuinely hard to reason about, and impossible to treat as a simple black box.",
      "The headline numbers are extraordinary, and they deserve equal skepticism. Since its December 2019 backtest start it shows about {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized against a {max_drawdown_abs} max drawdown, a {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and a {calmar_ratio} Calmar. Three cautions dominate. The drawdown is brutal, meaning you would have had to sit through losing more than three-quarters of the account at the worst point; the backtest window opens right before the 2020 to 2021 leveraged bull run and leans heavily on it, while the trailing one-year return here is negative; and the sheer number of tuned branches makes overfitting a genuine risk rather than a footnote. Treat it as the seed concept behind a large family and a study in aggressive design, not a recommendation to deploy capital as it stands."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "Beta Ballers rebalances daily across a 33-instrument held universe: leveraged long equity (TQQQ, UPRO, SPXL, SOXL, TECL, QLD, MVV, USD, CURE), unleveraged sector and international equity (PUI, EEM, EFA, EPI, EWZ), inverse equity (SQQQ, SPXS, SPXU, SOXS, TECS), volatility (UVXY, VIXY), treasuries and cash (TMF, TMV, AGG, SHY, BIL), commodities and energy (UCO, ERX, DBC, GLD) and currencies (UUP, EUO, YCS). TLT, IEF, HIBL and SPY appear only as signals, never held. The single top-level switch compares the 7-day RSI of BIL against IEF; the branch where BIL is relatively stronger is tiny (buy volatility if SPY is overbought, otherwise hold SOXL), and almost the entire tree lives in the other branch.",
      "That main branch runs a cascade of gates. It first checks the S&P for stress: a 6-day SPY RSI below 27 is treated as extreme oversold (going long leveraged, or short via SOXS/SQQQ depending on a SHY-versus-HIBL RSI check), and a 10-day SPY RSI below 30 triggers a dip-buy that takes the worst 5-day performer from a leveraged basket. Failing those, it reads volatility through UVXY's 10-day RSI, holding UVXY outright between the 74 and 84 tiers and dropping into a large 'bear market / high inflation' sub-tree above 84 and, in the normal case, below 74. That sub-tree is driven by interest rates: TLT relative to its 200-day average and the sign of TLT's 20-day return split it into rising-rate baskets (favoring TMV) and falling-rate baskets (favoring TMF), and inside each, a 210-day EMA versus 360-day SMA of SPY plus a SPY-versus-DBC trend comparison route between offensive leveraged baskets and defensive ones.",
      "Positions are chosen by 74 filter steps that rank a small pool over 5 to 22-day windows of moving-average return, cumulative return or RSI and take a single name. Most of them, 46 of 74, select the bottom of the pool (the weakest recent performer), so the engine is more contrarian dip-buying than trend-chasing, with 28 momentum-style top picks alongside. Tactical overlays recur throughout the tree: a TQQQ 11-day RSI above 77 flips to UVXY as an overbought fade (8 times), a TQQQ 10-day RSI below 30 forces a dip-buy, a 6-day TQQQ crash beyond -10% paired with a one-day pop above 5.5% buys UVXY, a 2-day SPY drop of -2% and an SPXU-6-day-versus-UPRO-3-day comparison flag crashes, and 'Defense | Modified' groups compare the 20-day standard deviation of DBC against SPY to decide when to sit in bonds, gold, cash-like SHY and BIL, or inverse funds."

      "Stripped to its essence, Rain's Unified Best Signals is a diversified, permanently-hedged bet on leveraged US tech that refuses to lean on any one signal. It stacks a large number of independent community strategies, TQQQ For The Long Term, The Holy Grail, KMLM Fund Surfing, Garen Phillips' dip-buyer, and a Safe Sectors bond rotation, and equal-weights them so that trend, momentum, mean-reversion, and managed-futures signals all vote at once. A VIX 'frontrunner' layer sits in front, stepping into UVXY or VIXY the moment several indices reach overbought RSI extremes, and a defensive 'Safe Sectors or Bonds' rotation absorbs capital whenever the leveraged sleeves stand down. The idea is that blending many proven signals smooths the ride and keeps the drawdown far shallower than any single leveraged strategy would.",
      "The backtested numbers are extraordinary and unusually well-balanced: {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized with a {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and a {calmar_ratio} Calmar, against a {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown that is remarkably shallow for {standard_deviation:0} volatility and heavy 3x exposure. Three cautions matter. First, the backtest is short, roughly 5.7 years, and only went out-of-sample in November 2025, so almost the entire record is an in-sample fit spanning the 2022 bear and the 2023 to 2025 AI bull, a stretch unusually kind to hedged dip-buyers. Second, the sheer complexity, dozens of stacked, individually-tuned thresholds, carries real overfitting risk: an ensemble this large can fit its own window more tightly than it generalizes. Third, it is still a leveraged system, so the shallow historical drawdown should be read as a property of a favourable, mostly in-sample window rather than a guarantee. Best understood as an ambitious attempt to diversify signal risk within leveraged tech, whose spectacular ratios deserve heavier discounting than a long, out-of-sample record would."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "Rain's Unified Best Signals is organized as an 'Aggressive Leveraged VIX/Long Frontrunner' wrapped around a large unified core. The frontrunner runs first as a ladder of overbought checks: if SPY RSI(10) exceeds 80, TECL exceeds 79, XLP exceeds 77.5, QQQ exceeds 79, or QQQE exceeds 79, the strategy steps into a volatility hedge, UVXY at the most extreme readings and VIXY at the milder ones. If nothing is overbought, it checks for a deep oversold dip: when TQQQ RSI(10) is below 31 it buys SOXL if SMH RSI(10) is below 23, TECL if QQQ RSI(10) is below 27, and otherwise routes through a 'Check With Bonds' gate that compares AGG against SH to pick either the defensive 'Safe Sectors or Bonds' basket or TECL. Only when neither the overbought ladder nor the oversold dip fires does the frontrunner hand off to the unified core.",
      "The core, named in the symphony as 'Rain's Unified Signals: TQQQ FTLT, Holy Grail & KMLM,' is an equal-weight blend of two parallel sub-strategies: one gated on SPY's 200-day moving average and one on TQQQ's 200-day moving average. Each runs the same modules. A 'Bull Cross' (price above the 200-day MA while the 3-day average is still below it, a fresh crossover) selects the top 2 by RSI(10) from {TQQQ, TECL, SPXL, TMF}; a 'Bear Cross' selects the top 2 from {SQQQ, TECS, SPXU, TMF, TMV}. In an established uptrend above the 200-day MA, the core stacks several named community modules, 'SPY on Bonds' (20-day AGG RSI vs 60-day SH RSI, plus an HYG-vs-SPY check), 'SPY on Staples' (20-day XLP RSI vs 20-day SH RSI), Garen Phillips' 'Buy the Dips' (QQQ 5-day return below -6%), and 'KMLM Fund Surfing', each of which either commits to TQQQ-led leveraged sleeves or steps aside to the defensive basket.",
      "'KMLM Fund Surfing' is the recurring regime switch: when XLK's 10-day RSI is above KMLM's (tech momentum beating managed futures), the module holds a TQQQ-heavy sleeve blended with TECL and SOXL; when KMLM leads, it rotates to the defensive basket or shorts through SQQQ and a {SQQQ, TECS, SOXS} sleeve. Below the 200-day moving average, each sub-strategy drops into 20-day SMA blocks on QQQ and TQQQ that use 10-day IEF vs 20-day PSQ RSI and a TQQQ 10-day return above 15% blow-off check to choose between TQQQ, SQQQ, and defense, with a deep-bear branch (QQQ 60-day return below -12%) comparing 15-day AGG RSI against TQQQ and QQQ. The defensive leaf throughout is 'Safe Sectors or Bonds,' a filter that buys the single lowest-RSI(10) name from {BSV, TLT, LQD, VBF, XLP, UGE, XLV, XLU}, a mean-reversion rotation across bonds and low-volatility sectors; its most recent selection, utilities (XLU), made up the bulk of the portfolio alongside a TQQQ sleeve."

      "Stripped to its essence, zoop's Frontrunner is a bet that short-term RSI extremes are reliable turning points, and it takes that bet in both directions with leverage. Most of the time it is simply long SPY, so its baseline is the market itself. The strategy only earns or loses its edge in the tails: at the bottom it swaps into a 3x fund to catch the sharpest available bounce, and at the top it swaps into long volatility to front-run the pullback its name refers to. What makes it unusual among the leveraged strategies here is how rarely it is actually leveraged. Every branch is all-or-nothing and the default state is unlevered, which is why its volatility sits far below what a permanent 3x holding would produce. It is best understood as an SPY position with two rented options attached, one on a violent bounce and one on a violent top, rather than as a leveraged strategy that occasionally steps aside.",
      "The backtested numbers are strong: {annualized_rate_of_return:0} annualized with a {sharpe_ratio} Sharpe and a {calmar_ratio} Calmar against a {max_drawdown_abs:0} max drawdown and {standard_deviation:0} volatility, over roughly 8.6 years. Four cautions matter, and the first outweighs the rest. The symphony's logic was last edited on 1 September 2026, so it has no out-of-sample record whatsoever; every figure here describes the same window the rules were selected against. Second, the backtest cannot begin before January 2018 because VXX is the youngest instrument in its universe, so the record misses 2008 and the 2015 to 2016 selloff outright. Third, the thresholds are precise in a way that invites overfitting: 23, 28, 28 and 79 are tuned numbers, and a twelve-name overbought basket carries a great many degrees of freedom for its size. Fourth, the compounded return leans on a small number of days, so it depends on a handful of switches having been timed correctly. The simplicity is a genuine virtue, the whole tree can be audited in a minute, but simplicity is not the same as robustness, and a freshly-edited strategy has earned no evidence yet."
    ],
    "how_it_works": [
      "The entire strategy is one ordered if-else ladder, evaluated top to bottom every day, that resolves to exactly one position. The first three rungs look for oversold conditions and buy the matching leveraged fund. If SMH's 10-day RSI is below 23 it buys SOXL, the 3x semiconductor fund. Otherwise, if QQQ's 10-day RSI is below 28 it buys TQQQ, the 3x Nasdaq-100 fund. Otherwise, if SPY's 10-day RSI is below 28 it buys SPXL, the 3x S&P 500 fund. The ordering is doing real work: semiconductors are checked first and given the tightest threshold of the three, so the deepest dip in the most volatile index takes priority over the broader ones, and SPY is only ever the dip-buy of last resort.",
      "If nothing is oversold, a single overbought check runs. It compares the 10-day RSI of twelve names against one ceiling of 79: SMH, QQQ, SPY, TQQQ, TECL, QQQE, VOOG, VOOV, VTV, FAS, XLP and XLY. The test is an 'any' condition, so one breach anywhere in that list is enough to fire it. When it does, the strategy buys VXX, a long-volatility ETN, front-running an expected pullback rather than merely stepping aside into cash or bonds. The breadth of the watchlist is the point: it spans the Nasdaq and the S&P, growth and value (VOOG, VOOV, VTV), semiconductors and 3x tech (SMH, TECL, TQQQ), financials (FAS) and both consumer sectors (XLP, XLY), so almost any broad rally that pushes one corner of the market to an RSI of 79 will put the portfolio into volatility.",
      "If neither the oversold ladder nor the overbought check fires, the strategy holds SPY, and this is the default state rather than an edge case. Rebalancing is daily and every branch terminates in a single asset, so the portfolio is always 100 percent in one instrument and can switch completely from one day to the next. Exactly five instruments are ever held: SOXL, TQQQ, SPXL, VXX and SPY. As of the most recent market day the ladder was in its default state, with the portfolio entirely in SPY."

      "leverage": "The three dip-buy legs are 3x daily-reset funds, SOXL on semiconductors, TQQQ on the Nasdaq-100 and SPXL on the S&P 500, all of which decay in choppy markets and can lose badly if a dip keeps going. VXX is not leveraged but is arguably the harsher instrument to hold: a long-volatility ETN in structural decay that bleeds steadily whenever the pullback it anticipates does not arrive. The mitigating fact is exposure time rather than exposure size, since the default state is unlevered SPY and the leveraged legs are visited only at RSI extremes.",
      "backtest_limits": "The record runs from 18 January 2018 to 1 September 2026, about 8.6 years. It cannot start earlier because VXX is the youngest instrument in the universe, so 2008 and the 2015 to 2016 selloff are missing entirely. What it does cover is useful: the February 2018 volatility spike, the Q4 2018 drawdown, the 2020 crash and the 2022 bear market are all inside the window. The decisive limitation is not length but freshness: the logic was last edited on 1 September 2026, so the strategy has no out-of-sample record at all and every metric describes the window its own rules were chosen against.",
      "signal": "One indicator carries the whole strategy. Every branch is a 10-day RSI reading, so there is no trend filter, no moving-average regime gate and no confirmation of any kind, and a single indicator misbehaving misroutes the entire portfolio. The thresholds are also finely tuned (23, 28, 28 and 79) and a twelve-name overbought basket offers many degrees of freedom, which is where the overfitting risk sits. The offsetting virtue is auditability: the tree is five rules deep and can be checked by hand in a minute, which is not true of most strategies in this library.",
      "hedge": "VXX is the only defensive state, and it is a directional long-volatility bet rather than ballast. It pays off sharply when a top is called correctly and bleeds when it is not, so it does not behave like the bond and staples rotations that other strategies here fall back on. There is no cash leg, no bond leg and no inverse equity leg anywhere in the tree.",
      "concentration": "Concentration is total by construction. Every branch resolves to one asset, so the portfolio is always 100 percent in a single instrument, and the reachable universe is only five names: SOXL, TQQQ, SPXL, VXX and SPY. Turnover is correspondingly high, since the ladder is re-evaluated daily and any switch is a complete one.",
      "suitability": "Reasonable for someone who wants market exposure as the default and is willing to accept short, violent excursions into 3x funds and long volatility at the edges. It is not a strategy to size on its backtest, because that backtest contains no out-of-sample evidence yet."

Each reconstruction figure is the modelled result of evaluating this strategy's own symphony tree over those same closes: a reading of the rules rather than a backtest, with no fees, no slippage and no rebalance timing, quoted here to rank the regimes rather than as a return you could have earned. Turnover of one change every 17.3 trading days is low enough that the modelled path tracks something real, which is why it is quoted on this page and not on several others in this library. **Read it alongside one caveat.** The margin over the index is concentrated in very few days: removing the five best takes the full-record path from +3,090.2% to +920.1%, and the three leveraged legs were held for 5, 22 and 38 days respectively. A result that depends on being in a 3x fund on the right handful of days is more fragile than the summary figures suggest. Windows before 16 January 2018 were left out because they fall outside the record, which runs {backtest_days} trading days to 27 August 2026."
